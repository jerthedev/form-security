# Accuracy Testing with Real-world Data Sets

**Ticket ID**: Test-Implementation/2026-accuracy-testing-real-world-datasets  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Accuracy validation using real-world spam and legitimate form submission datasets

## Description
Validate spam detection accuracy using curated real-world datasets including known spam submissions, legitimate form data, and edge cases to ensure accuracy targets are met.

**Dependencies:**
- Ticket 2022 (Feature Testing) - Complete workflows must be tested first

**Expected outcomes:**
- Validated accuracy against real-world spam and legitimate data
- False positive and false negative rate validation
- Edge case handling verification
- Threshold optimization based on real data

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-world spam dataset testing (95%+ detection accuracy)
- [ ] Legitimate form submission testing (<2% false positive rate)
- [ ] Edge case dataset testing
- [ ] Cultural and language variation testing
- [ ] Form type specific accuracy testing
- [ ] Threshold optimization based on real data
- [ ] Analyzer-specific accuracy validation
- [ ] Accuracy regression testing framework
- [ ] Performance impact of accuracy optimizations
- [ ] A/B testing framework for threshold tuning

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [x] Ticket 2022 (Feature Testing) - MUST BE COMPLETED
