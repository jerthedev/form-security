## Title
Research modern testing frameworks, tools, and best practices for Laravel package development

## Description
Conduct comprehensive research into modern testing frameworks, tools, and best practices specifically for Laravel package development to inform the implementation of a world-class testing infrastructure for JTD-FormSecurity.

This research will focus on:
- PHPUnit 12.x features and Laravel integration best practices
- Modern testing approaches for Laravel packages
- Code coverage tools and reporting strategies
- Static analysis tools and quality metrics
- Test organization and execution optimization
- Performance testing frameworks and benchmarking
- Security testing tools and vulnerability assessment
- Industry best practices from leading Laravel packages

The findings will directly inform the testing architecture design and tool selection for achieving 100% test coverage and comprehensive quality assurance.
