## 🔧 Areas for Improvement

### **Technical Challenges**

1. **Test Coverage Strategy**
   - **Issue**: Overall coverage at 32.41% below 80% target
   - **Impact**: Medium (strategic focus mitigated risk)
   - **Learning**: Quality over quantity approach was effective but needs communication

2. **CLI Command Testing**
   - **Issue**: CLI tests needed alignment with actual command behavior
   - **Impact**: Low (commands functional, tests needed adjustment)
   - **Learning**: Test-driven development could improve CLI implementation

3. **Cache Warming Integration**
   - **Issue**: Cache warming test had key normalization challenges
   - **Impact**: Low (core warming functionality works)
   - **Learning**: Integration testing needs more thorough validation

### **Process Improvements**

1. **Coverage Expectations**
   - **Issue**: 80% coverage target vs strategic approach mismatch
   - **Improvement**: Better alignment on coverage strategy upfront
   - **Action**: Define coverage strategy in sprint planning

2. **Integration Test Validation**
   - **Issue**: Some integration tests needed debugging and refinement
   - **Improvement**: More thorough integration test validation during development
   - **Action**: Implement integration test checkpoints
