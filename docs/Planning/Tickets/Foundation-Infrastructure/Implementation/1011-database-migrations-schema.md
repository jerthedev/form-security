# Database Migrations & Schema

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/1011-database-migrations-schema  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Database Migrations & Schema - Create all database tables with optimized indexing for high-volume applications

## Description
Implement comprehensive database migrations for all 5 core tables required by the JTD-FormSecurity package. This includes creating optimized database schema with strategic indexing for analytics queries, foreign key constraints for data integrity, and support for 10,000+ daily form submissions with sub-100ms query performance.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Create migration files for all 5 core tables (blocked_submissions, ip_reputation, spam_patterns, geolite2_locations, geolite2_ipv4_blocks)
- Implement comprehensive indexing strategy for high-performance analytics queries
- Set up foreign key constraints with proper cascade rules for data integrity
- Create database seeders for initial spam patterns and test data
- Implement chunked GeoLite2 import system for memory-efficient data loading
- Add migration rollback procedures and data backup strategies
- Optimize schema for concurrent writes up to 1,000 submissions/minute

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Provides the data storage foundation for all package functionality
- Enables high-performance analytics and reporting capabilities
- Supports enterprise-scale applications with proper indexing and optimization
- Ensures data integrity through proper foreign key relationships

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: No database schema exists - complete database design implementation needed
- Desired: Fully optimized database schema supporting high-volume operations with sub-100ms queries

**Dependencies:**
- Service provider implementation for database connection management
- Laravel 12 migration system and Eloquent ORM features
- Database system (MySQL 8.0+, PostgreSQL 12+, or SQLite 3.8+)
