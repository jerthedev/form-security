## Title
Temporary Email Domain Detection - Detection and blocking of temporary/disposable email domains

## Feature Overview
This specification defines a comprehensive temporary email domain detection system that identifies and blocks disposable email addresses commonly used for spam registrations and fraudulent activities. The system maintains an extensive database of temporary email domains, provides real-time detection capabilities, and includes automated updates to stay current with new disposable email services.

The temporary email detection system includes pattern-based detection, domain reputation analysis, automated domain discovery, whitelist management for legitimate services, and comprehensive logging and monitoring. It integrates seamlessly with user registration and form validation systems to prevent spam account creation.

Key capabilities include:
- Comprehensive database of temporary and disposable email domains
- Real-time email domain validation and blocking
- Pattern-based detection for new temporary email services
- Automated domain discovery and database updates
- Whitelist management for legitimate email services
- Domain reputation analysis and risk scoring
- Integration with user registration and validation systems
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring of blocked attempts
