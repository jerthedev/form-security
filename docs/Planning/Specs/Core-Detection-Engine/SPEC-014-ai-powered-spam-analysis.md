## Title
AI-Powered Spam Analysis - xAI/OpenAI integration for intelligent content analysis

## Feature Overview
This specification defines an advanced AI-powered spam analysis system that integrates with leading AI services (xAI/OpenAI) to provide intelligent content analysis for sophisticated spam detection. The system uses large language models to analyze content context, intent, and patterns that traditional rule-based systems might miss, providing enhanced accuracy for borderline cases.

The AI analysis system is designed for cost-effective operation through intelligent triggering mechanisms, comprehensive caching, and configurable usage limits. It operates as an enhancement layer that activates only for borderline spam scores, optimizing both accuracy and operational costs while maintaining system performance.

Key capabilities include:
- Multi-provider AI service integration (xAI Grok, OpenAI GPT)
- Intelligent triggering for borderline spam cases
- Form-specific AI analysis prompts and scoring
- Comprehensive cost management and usage tracking
- Advanced caching with content-based keys
- Fallback mechanisms for service failures
- Real-time confidence scoring and analysis
- Bulk analysis capabilities for batch processing

## Purpose & Rationale
### Business Justification
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: AI analysis significantly improves detection of sophisticated spam attempts
- **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent triggering minimizes AI service costs while maximizing value
- **Competitive Advantage**: Advanced AI capabilities provide superior spam protection
- **Future-Proofing**: AI integration enables adaptation to evolving spam techniques

### Technical Justification
- **Context Understanding**: AI models understand content context and intent beyond pattern matching
- **Adaptability**: AI analysis adapts to new spam techniques without manual rule updates
- **Precision**: Reduces false positives through sophisticated content understanding
