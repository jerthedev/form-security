**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/6005-monitoring-dashboard-requirements-analysis  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Analyze and break down monitoring, alerting, and dashboard requirements for real-time system oversight

## Description
Conduct detailed analysis of monitoring, alerting, and dashboard requirements focusing on real-time system oversight, user interfaces, and notification systems. This includes breaking down MonitoringService, ReportingService, AlertingService, and dashboard component requirements into implementable features.

**Monitoring System Requirements:**
- Real-time monitoring of spam detection performance and system health
- Configurable alert thresholds and notification triggers
- System performance monitoring for all package components
- Threat detection and anomaly identification
- Service health checks and availability monitoring
- Integration with Laravel's monitoring ecosystem

**Dashboard & Reporting Requirements:**
- Administrative dashboard with key security metrics
- Interactive data visualization and charts
- Customizable reporting templates and schedules
- Real-time dashboard updates and live data streaming
- Export capabilities for reports and data
- User experience design for security management

**Alerting System Requirements:**
- Multi-channel notification system (email, Slack, Discord, webhooks)
- Intelligent alert aggregation and fatigue prevention
- Priority-based alert routing and escalation
- Alert acknowledgment and resolution tracking
- Integration with existing notification infrastructure
- Customizable alert templates and formatting

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: Analyze existing code, plan implementation, generate tickets for Implementation, Test Implementation, and Code Cleanup based on findings

## Notes
Critical considerations for monitoring and dashboard components:
- **User Experience**: Avoid overwhelming users with complex interfaces
- **Alert Fatigue**: Implement intelligent thresholds and aggregation
- **Performance**: Dashboard must load quickly even with large datasets
- **Real-time**: Live updates without impacting system performance

Key risks to address:
- Dashboard complexity overwhelming users
- Alert fatigue from excessive notifications
- Real-time monitoring creating performance bottlenecks
- Poor user adoption due to complex interfaces

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)
