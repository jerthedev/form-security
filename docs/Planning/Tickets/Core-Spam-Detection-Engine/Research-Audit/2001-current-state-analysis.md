**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Complete

## Title
Analyze current codebase state and identify gaps for Core Spam Detection Engine implementation

## Description
Conduct comprehensive analysis of the existing JTD-FormSecurity codebase to understand the current state of spam detection components and identify gaps that need to be filled for EPIC-002 implementation. This analysis will serve as the foundation for all subsequent research and implementation tickets.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Audit existing spam detection related code, documentation, and specifications
- Identify implemented vs planned components in the current codebase
- Analyze existing database schema and models for spam detection
- Review current configuration system and integration points
- Document gaps between current state and Epic requirements

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Provides baseline understanding of existing components to avoid duplication
- Identifies reusable code and architectural patterns already in place
- Ensures new implementation integrates properly with existing infrastructure
- Prevents breaking changes to already implemented features

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: Documentation exists but implementation status unclear
- Desired: Complete understanding of what exists vs what needs to be built

**Dependencies:**
- Access to complete codebase and documentation
- Understanding of EPIC-001 Foundation Infrastructure completion status

**Expected outcomes:**
- Detailed inventory of existing spam detection components
- Gap analysis document identifying missing implementations
- Integration strategy for new components with existing architecture
- Risk assessment for potential breaking changes
