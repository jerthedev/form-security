# Implementation Planning & Ticket Generation

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/3006-implementation-planning-ticket-generation  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Create Detailed Implementation Plan and Generate Implementation Phase Tickets

## Description
Based on all Research/Audit findings, create a comprehensive implementation plan and generate detailed Implementation, Test Implementation, and Code Cleanup tickets for EPIC-003. This planning consolidates all research findings into actionable development tasks with clear dependencies, priorities, and success criteria.

### What needs to be accomplished:
- Consolidate findings from all Research/Audit tickets (3001-3005)
- Create detailed implementation roadmap with phases and dependencies
- Generate comprehensive Implementation tickets for all Epic components
- Generate Test Implementation tickets with performance and security validation
- Generate Code Cleanup tickets for optimization and refactoring
- Plan implementation sequence and dependency management
- Create success criteria and acceptance testing plans

### Why this work is necessary:
- Translates research findings into actionable development tasks
- Ensures systematic implementation of all Epic requirements
- Establishes clear dependencies and implementation sequence
- Provides detailed guidance for development team
- Enables progress tracking and milestone management

### Current state vs desired state:
- **Current**: Research completed but no implementation tickets exist
- **Desired**: Complete set of Implementation, Test Implementation, and Code Cleanup tickets
- **Gap**: Need systematic ticket generation based on research findings

3. Create detailed implementation roadmap with phases and dependencies
4. Generate comprehensive Implementation tickets (3010-3019 range)
5. Generate Test Implementation tickets (3020-3029 range)
6. Generate Code Cleanup tickets (3030-3039 range) if needed
7. Plan implementation sequence and dependency management
8. Create success criteria and acceptance testing plans
9. Identify any dependencies or prerequisites

11. Highlight any potential risks or challenges
12. Pause and wait for my review before proceeding with ticket generation

Please be thorough and consider all aspects of Laravel development including code implementation, testing, documentation, and integration.
```

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: 
  - Gather requirements
  - Search latest information about APIs and development practices including how other developers have solved similar problems using Brave Search MCP
  - Analyze existing code, plan implementation
  - Generate tickets for Implementation, Test Implementation, and Code Cleanup based on findings
- Implementation: Develop new features, update documentation
- Test Implementation: Write tests, verify functionality, performance, security
- Code Cleanup: Refactor, optimize, remove technical debt (optional, only if needed)
