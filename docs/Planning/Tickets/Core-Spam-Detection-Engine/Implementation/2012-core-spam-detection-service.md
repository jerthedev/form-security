# Core SpamDetectionService Implementation

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/2012-core-spam-detection-service  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Complete - All acceptance criteria met, tests passing

## Title
Implement core SpamDetectionService with pattern-based spam detection algorithms

## Description
Create the central SpamDetectionService that orchestrates spam detection across multiple analyzers and provides the primary interface for form spam analysis. This service implements the hybrid detection approach with weighted scoring and integrates with the existing FormSecurityService.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Implement core SpamDetectionService class with all detection methods
- Integrate with existing SpamDetectionContract from current codebase
- Create pattern analyzer orchestration and weighted scoring system
- Implement form submission analysis workflow with early exit optimization
- Add spam score calculation with configurable thresholds
- Integrate with Epic-001 caching system for performance optimization
- Implement rate limiting and submission tracking
- Add comprehensive logging and analytics collection
- Create service provider registration and dependency injection setup

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Provides the primary spam detection interface for the entire package
- Orchestrates multiple pattern analyzers into cohesive detection system
- Required for integration with existing FormSecurityService
- Enables configurable spam detection with performance optimization

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: SpamDetectionContract exists, database and model layer available
- Desired: Complete spam detection service with hybrid algorithm implementation

**Dependencies:**
- Ticket 2010 (Database Schema) - Required for spam data storage
- Ticket 2011 (SpamPattern Model) - Required for pattern data access
- SpamDetectionContract - Existing interface in src/Contracts/
- Epic-001 CacheService - For result and pattern caching

**Expected outcomes:**
- Production-ready SpamDetectionService implementing all contract methods
- Hybrid detection algorithm with configurable weights
- Sub-50ms processing time with caching optimization
- Integration with Epic-001 infrastructure services
