# Implementation Planning & Ticket Generation

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/8005-implementation-planning-ticket-generation  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Create detailed implementation roadmap and generate all subsequent phase tickets

## Description
Synthesize all research findings from tickets 8001-8004 to create a comprehensive implementation roadmap for the JTD-FormSecurity documentation system. Generate detailed Implementation, Test Implementation, and Code Cleanup phase tickets with proper sequencing, dependencies, and resource allocation.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Synthesize findings from all previous research tickets into cohesive implementation plan
- Create detailed timeline and milestone planning for documentation system development
- Generate complete set of Implementation phase tickets with proper sequencing
- Generate Test Implementation phase tickets for validation and quality assurance
- Generate Code Cleanup phase tickets for optimization and maintenance
- Plan deployment and go-live strategy with rollback procedures

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Ensures systematic and efficient execution of documentation system development
- Provides clear roadmap and accountability for all implementation work
- Establishes proper dependencies and sequencing to avoid bottlenecks
- Creates measurable milestones for tracking progress and success
- Enables resource planning and timeline estimation

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: Research completed but no implementation roadmap or tickets
- Desired: Complete set of actionable tickets ready for implementation execution

**Dependencies:**
- Completion of 8001-current-state-documentation-analysis
- Completion of 8002-documentation-technology-stack-research
- Completion of 8003-documentation-architecture-planning
- Completion of 8004-content-strategy-user-experience-planning

**Expected outcomes:**
- Detailed implementation roadmap with timeline and milestones
- Complete set of Implementation phase tickets (8010-8099 range)
- Complete set of Test Implementation phase tickets (8100-8199 range)
- Code Cleanup phase tickets if needed (8200-8299 range)
- Deployment and maintenance procedures

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel package development expert specializing in project planning and ticket generation. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Documentation-Deployment/Research-Audit/8005-implementation-planning-ticket-generation.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

TICKET DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
- Template: docs/Planning/Tickets/template.md
- Major Features: Epics defined in docs/Planning/Epics/
- Phases: Research/Audit, Implementation, Test Implementation, Code Cleanup
- Format: docs/Planning/Tickets/<Major Feature>/<Phase>/####-short-description.md
- Numbering: 8000s for EPIC-008 Documentation & Deployment

Based on this ticket and all previous research findings:
1. Synthesize all research from tickets 8001-8004 into comprehensive implementation plan
2. Create detailed timeline with phases, milestones, and dependencies
3. Generate complete set of Implementation phase tickets (8010-8099) covering:
   - Documentation tool setup and configuration
   - API documentation generation and integration
   - User guide content creation and organization
   - Code example development and testing
   - Documentation site development and deployment
   - Search functionality implementation
   - Performance optimization and accessibility compliance
4. Generate Test Implementation phase tickets (8100-8199) covering validation and quality assurance
5. Generate Code Cleanup phase tickets (8200-8299) if needed for optimization
6. Plan deployment strategy and maintenance procedures

Please ensure all tickets follow the template format and include proper dependencies, acceptance criteria, and effort estimates.
```

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: 
  - Gather requirements
  - Search latest information about APIs and development practices including how other developers have solved similar problems using Brave Search MCP
  - Analyze existing code, plan implementation
  - Generate tickets for Implementation, Test Implementation, and Code Cleanup based on findings
- Implementation: Develop new features, update documentation
- Test Implementation: Write tests, verify functionality, performance, security
- Code Cleanup: Refactor, optimize, remove technical debt (optional, only if needed)

## Notes
This ticket represents the culmination of the Research/Audit phase and the foundation for successful implementation. Key considerations:
- All implementation tickets must be actionable and have clear acceptance criteria
- Proper sequencing is crucial to avoid dependencies and bottlenecks
- Quality gates must be established to ensure each ticket meets Epic requirements
- Deployment strategy must include staging and rollback procedures
- Maintenance procedures are essential for long-term documentation currency

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-8 hours)

## Dependencies
