# Architecture & Integration Design - Analytics & Monitoring System

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/6003-architecture-integration-design  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Design comprehensive architecture and integration strategy for analytics and monitoring system

## Description
Design the complete architecture for the analytics and monitoring system based on current state analysis and technology research. This includes service architecture, data flow design, integration patterns, and performance optimization strategies.

**Architecture Design Requirements:**
- Design service architecture for analytics, monitoring, reporting, and alerting
- Plan data flow from collection to visualization
- Design real-time monitoring and alerting architecture
- Plan dashboard component structure and API design
- Design integration with existing spam detection services
- Plan performance optimization and caching strategies

**Integration Design Requirements:**
- Design integration with existing event system for real-time data collection
- Plan integration with core spam detection services for data source
- Design integration with external services for enhanced analytics
- Plan queue system integration for background processing
- Design cache system integration for performance optimization
- Plan database schema enhancements for analytics data

**Performance Architecture:**
- Design to meet <10ms analytics processing overhead requirement
- Plan for <2 second dashboard load times with 30 days of data
- Design for 100,000+ blocked submissions without performance degradation
- Plan data aggregation and retention strategies
- Design efficient query patterns for analytics data

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel package development expert specializing in form security and spam prevention. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Analytics-Monitoring/Research-Audit/6003-architecture-integration-design.md

CONTEXT:
- Package: JTD-FormSecurity - Laravel 12 package for form security and spam prevention
- Epic: EPIC-006 Analytics & Monitoring - Comprehensive analytics, reporting, and monitoring
- Dependencies: Current state analysis (6001) and technology research (6002) findings
- Requirements: <10ms overhead, <2s dashboard loads, 100k+ submissions support

ARCHITECTURE DESIGN TASKS:
1. **Service Architecture**: Design BlockedSubmissionsTrackingService, MonitoringService, AnalyticsService, ReportingService, AlertingService
2. **Data Flow Design**: Collection → Processing → Storage → Visualization → Alerting
3. **Integration Design**: Event system, queue system, cache system, database integration
4. **Performance Architecture**: Caching strategies, data aggregation, query optimization
5. **Real-time Architecture**: Live monitoring, instant alerting, dashboard updates

DELIVERABLES:
- Complete service architecture diagrams and specifications
- Data flow architecture with performance considerations
- Integration patterns with existing JTD-FormSecurity components
- Database schema design for analytics data
- API design for dashboard and reporting endpoints
- Performance optimization strategy
- Security and privacy architecture
- Scalability and resilience design

Base your design on findings from tickets 6001 and 6002, ensuring seamless integration with existing components while meeting all Epic requirements.
```

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: Analyze existing code, plan implementation, generate tickets for Implementation, Test Implementation, and Code Cleanup based on findings

## Notes
Architecture must address key Epic risks:
- Analytics data storage growth affecting performance
- Real-time monitoring creating bottlenecks
- Alert fatigue from excessive notifications
- Dashboard complexity overwhelming users

Design principles:
- Modular architecture with graceful degradation
- Performance-first with sub-100ms overhead
- Scalable for high-volume deployments
- Secure by design with privacy considerations
- Laravel 12 native integration

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] 6001-current-state-analysis - Understanding of existing components
- [ ] 6002-technology-best-practices-research - Technology choices and patterns
- [ ] EPIC-006 requirements and constraints
- [ ] SPEC-016 technical specifications
