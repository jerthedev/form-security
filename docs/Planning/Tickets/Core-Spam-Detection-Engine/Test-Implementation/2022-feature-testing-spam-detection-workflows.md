**Ticket ID**: Test-Implementation/2022-feature-testing-spam-detection-workflows  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
End-to-end feature testing for complete spam detection workflows

## Description
Create comprehensive feature tests that validate complete spam detection workflows from form submission through final spam decision, including integration with existing FormSecurityService and real-world scenarios.

**Dependencies:**
- Ticket 2017 (Score Calculator) - Complete workflow requires scoring
- All Implementation tickets (2010-2019) - Full system must be implemented

**Expected outcomes:**
- Complete workflow validation from submission to decision
- Integration testing with existing package components
- Real-world scenario testing with sample spam/legitimate data
- End-to-end performance validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] End-to-end spam detection workflow tests implemented
- [ ] Integration with FormSecurityService validated
