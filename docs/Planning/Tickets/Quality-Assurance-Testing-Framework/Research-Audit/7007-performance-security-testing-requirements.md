# Performance & Security Testing Requirements - Quality Assurance & Testing Framework

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/7007-performance-security-testing-requirements  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Define comprehensive performance and security testing requirements for package validation

## Description
Define detailed requirements for performance and security testing that will validate the JTD-FormSecurity package meets its performance targets and security standards. This analysis will establish benchmarks, testing methodologies, and validation criteria for critical performance and security aspects.

This requirements analysis will address:
- Performance testing framework requirements and benchmarking
- Algorithm efficiency validation and optimization testing
- Load testing for high-volume scenarios and scalability
- Memory usage monitoring and optimization validation
- Security testing and vulnerability assessment requirements
- Penetration testing considerations and methodologies
- Security scan integration and automation requirements
- Performance regression detection and monitoring

The requirements will ensure the package meets its sub-100ms detection times and maintains robust security standards.
