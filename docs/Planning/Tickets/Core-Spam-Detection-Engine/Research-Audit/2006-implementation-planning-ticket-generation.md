# Implementation Planning & Ticket Generation

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/2006-implementation-planning-ticket-generation  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Create comprehensive implementation roadmap and generate Implementation, Test Implementation, and Code Cleanup tickets

## Description
Synthesize all research findings from previous Research/Audit tickets to create a detailed implementation roadmap and generate all subsequent phase tickets for EPIC-002. This ticket will transform research insights into actionable implementation tasks with proper sequencing, dependencies, and success criteria.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Synthesize findings from all Research/Audit tickets into comprehensive implementation plan
- Generate detailed Implementation phase tickets with specific deliverables
- Generate Test Implementation phase tickets with comprehensive testing strategies
- Generate Code Cleanup phase tickets for optimization and refinement
- Establish proper ticket dependencies and sequencing
- Create Epic completion checklist and success validation criteria

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Transforms research into actionable implementation tasks
- Ensures proper sequencing and dependency management
- Provides clear roadmap for development team execution
- Establishes comprehensive testing and quality assurance strategy
- Creates framework for Epic completion validation

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: Research completed but no implementation roadmap
- Desired: Complete ticket set ready for development team execution

**Dependencies:**
- Ticket 2001 (Current State Analysis) - Implementation gap analysis
- Ticket 2002 (Technology Research) - Technology stack decisions
- Ticket 2003 (Architecture Design) - System architecture blueprint
- Ticket 2004 (Pattern Engine Design) - Algorithm specifications
- Ticket 2005 (Performance & Security) - Requirements and constraints

**Expected outcomes:**
- Complete set of Implementation phase tickets (estimated 8-12 tickets)
- Complete set of Test Implementation phase tickets (estimated 4-6 tickets)
- Complete set of Code Cleanup phase tickets (estimated 2-4 tickets)
- Epic completion roadmap with milestones and validation criteria
- Risk mitigation strategies for identified implementation challenges

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel package development expert specializing in form security and spam prevention. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Core-Spam-Detection-Engine/Research-Audit/2006-implementation-planning-ticket-generation.md

CONTEXT:
- Package: JTD-FormSecurity for Laravel 12.x and PHP 8.2+
- Epic: EPIC-002 Core Spam Detection Engine
- Research Phase: All Research/Audit tickets (2001-2005) completed
- Target: Generate complete implementation roadmap and all subsequent tickets

TICKET GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Implementation Phase Tickets (2010-2019)**:
   - Core SpamDetectionService implementation
   - Pattern analyzer implementations (Name, Email, Content, Behavioral)
   - Scoring algorithm and threshold management
   - Database schema and model implementations
   - Configuration system implementation
   - Caching system integration
   - Event system implementation
   - Service provider registration

2. **Test Implementation Phase Tickets (2020-2029)**:
   - Unit testing for all services and analyzers
   - Feature testing for spam detection workflows
   - Performance testing and benchmarking
   - Security testing and vulnerability assessment
   - Integration testing with Laravel components
   - Accuracy testing with real-world data sets

3. **Code Cleanup Phase Tickets (2030-2039)**:
   - Performance optimization based on testing results
   - Code refactoring and technical debt reduction
   - Documentation completion and review
   - Final integration testing and validation

TICKET CREATION STRATEGY:
- Use ticket template from docs/Planning/Tickets/template.md
- Ensure proper numbering (2010s, 2020s, 2030s)
- Establish clear dependencies between tickets
- Include specific acceptance criteria and deliverables
- Reference research findings from previous tickets
- Include comprehensive AI prompts for implementation guidance

IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCING:
- Consider dependencies between components
- Prioritize core services before specialized analyzers
- Ensure database and configuration setup before service implementation
- Plan testing tickets to validate each implementation ticket
- Schedule cleanup tickets after implementation and testing completion

Create comprehensive implementation plan with:
- Detailed ticket specifications for each phase
- Dependency mapping and sequencing recommendations
- Resource allocation and effort estimates
- Risk mitigation strategies for complex implementations
- Quality assurance checkpoints and validation criteria

Generate all tickets using the established template and save to appropriate phase directories.
```

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: Synthesize research findings and create comprehensive implementation roadmap
- Implementation: Execute development tasks according to generated tickets and roadmap
- Test Implementation: Validate implementations through comprehensive testing strategy
- Code Cleanup: Optimize and refine based on implementation and testing results

## Notes
This ticket represents the culmination of the Research/Audit phase and sets the foundation for successful Epic execution. The quality and completeness of the generated tickets will directly impact the success of the entire Epic.
