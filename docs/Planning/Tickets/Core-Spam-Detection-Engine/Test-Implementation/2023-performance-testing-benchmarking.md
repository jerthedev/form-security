## Title
Comprehensive performance testing and benchmarking for spam detection system

## Description
Create comprehensive performance tests and benchmarks to validate that the spam detection system meets all performance requirements under various load conditions and usage patterns.

**Dependencies:**
- Ticket 2018 (Pattern Cache Integration) - Caching must be implemented for performance testing

**Expected outcomes:**
- Comprehensive performance benchmarking under various load conditions
- Validation of all performance targets and requirements
- Performance regression testing framework
- Load testing with high-volume scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance benchmarks created for all major components
- [ ] Load testing implemented for high-volume scenarios (10,000+ daily submissions)
- [ ] Response time validation: <50ms P95 for complete spam detection
- [ ] Memory usage validation: <20MB per operation
- [ ] Cache performance validation: 90%+ hit ratio
- [ ] Database query performance validation: <20ms P95
- [ ] Analyzer-specific performance testing with individual targets
- [ ] Performance regression testing framework implemented
- [ ] Concurrent request handling testing
- [ ] Performance monitoring and alerting integration

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-8 hours) - Performance testing and benchmarking framework

## Dependencies
- [x] Ticket 2018 (Pattern Cache Integration) - MUST BE COMPLETED
