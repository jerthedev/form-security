# Event System & Notifications Specification

**Spec ID**: SPEC-022-event-system-notifications  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: Optional  
**Related Epic**: EPIC-005 - JTD-FormSecurity Specialized Features

## Title
Event System & Notifications - Laravel event system for spam detection and blocking events

## Feature Overview
This specification defines a comprehensive event system and notification framework for the JTD-FormSecurity package that provides real-time event broadcasting, customizable event handlers, and multi-channel notification capabilities. The system enables developers to respond to spam detection events, customize behavior through event listeners, and receive notifications about security events.

The event system includes a complete set of spam detection events, user registration events, system health events, and administrative events. It provides integration with Laravel's event system, queue-based event processing, and comprehensive notification channels including Slack, email, Discord, and custom webhooks.

Key capabilities include:
- Comprehensive event system for all spam detection activities
- Multi-channel notification system (Slack, email, Discord, webhooks)
- Customizable event handlers and listeners
- Queue-based event processing for performance optimization
- Event filtering and conditional notification logic
- Real-time event broadcasting for dashboard updates
- Event aggregation and batching for high-volume scenarios
- Integration with monitoring and alerting systems

## Purpose & Rationale
### Business Justification
- **Real-time Awareness**: Immediate notification of security events enables rapid response
- **Customization**: Event system allows custom business logic and integrations
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated notifications reduce manual monitoring overhead
- **Compliance Support**: Event logging supports audit trails and compliance requirements

### Technical Justification
- **Decoupling**: Event system enables loose coupling between spam detection and response logic
- **Extensibility**: Event listeners allow custom functionality without modifying core code
- **Performance**: Queue-based processing prevents event handling from impacting response times
- **Integration**: Standard Laravel events enable integration with existing application logic
