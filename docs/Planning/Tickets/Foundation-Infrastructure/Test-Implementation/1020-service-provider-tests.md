# Service Provider Tests

**Ticket ID**: Test-Implementation/1020-service-provider-tests  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Complete

## Title
Service Provider Tests - Comprehensive testing for service provider registration and dependency injection

## Description
Implement comprehensive test coverage for the FormSecurityServiceProvider including service registration, dependency injection, conditional service loading, and Laravel 12 enhanced features. Tests will validate proper service binding, facade functionality, and performance benchmarks for bootstrap operations.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Create unit tests for service provider registration and binding
- Test conditional service registration based on configuration flags
- Validate dependency injection container bindings and resolution
- Test facade functionality and API methods
- Implement performance tests for bootstrap operations (<50ms target)
- Create integration tests for service provider with Laravel framework
- Test deferred service provider functionality and lazy loading
- Validate service provider compatibility across different Laravel configurations

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Ensures reliable service provider functionality across different environments
- Validates performance targets for package bootstrap operations
- Provides confidence in dependency injection and service resolution
- Enables regression testing for service provider changes

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: No service provider tests exist - complete test implementation needed
- Desired: Comprehensive test coverage (95%+) for all service provider functionality

**Dependencies:**
- Service provider implementation (ticket 1010)
- PHPUnit 12 testing framework setup
- Laravel testing utilities and Orchestra Testbench

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: Service provider architecture and testing patterns researched
- Implementation: Service provider functionality implemented
- Test Implementation: Write tests, verify functionality, performance, integration
- Code Cleanup: Refactor, optimize, remove technical debt (optional, only if needed)

## Notes
This ticket ensures the foundational service provider functionality is thoroughly tested and reliable. The service provider is critical for all other package functionality, so comprehensive testing is essential for package stability and performance.
