## Research Findings & Decisions
### Key Findings
- **No Implementation Exists**: Complete greenfield development required - no source code, composer.json, or package structure exists
- **Excellent Specifications**: Comprehensive and well-structured planning with 95% complete specifications for all foundation components
- **Laravel 12 Updates Needed**: Current specifications reference Laravel 10.x/11.x but project requires Laravel 12.x and PHP 8.2+
- **Critical Missing Components**: All implementation components missing - service provider, migrations, models, configuration, caching, CLI commands, tests
- **Foundation Ready**: All planning complete with detailed specifications, ready for 4-phase implementation approach

### Architecture Decisions
- **Service Provider Architecture**: Laravel 12 enhanced service provider with conditional service registration and deferred providers for performance
- **Database Schema Strategy**: 5 core tables with comprehensive indexing for 10,000+ daily submissions, chunked GeoLite2 import for memory efficiency
- **Configuration Management**: Modular feature toggles with graceful degradation, environment variable integration, and runtime updates
- **Caching Strategy**: Three-tier caching (Request → Memory → Database) with configurable TTL and intelligent invalidation

### Technology Choices
- **Laravel 12 Features**: Enhanced service container, improved caching with tagging/invalidation, advanced console commands, modern testing utilities
- **PHP 8.2+ Features**: Readonly properties, enums, modern type hints, and performance improvements
- **Testing Framework**: PHPUnit 12 with Laravel 12 testing utilities, Epic/Sprint/Ticket grouping strategy, 90%+ coverage target
