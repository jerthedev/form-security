## Notes
This sprint focuses on establishing a solid foundation for Epic-002 development through comprehensive research and planning. Key considerations include:

- **Foundation Integration**: Leverage Epic-001 infrastructure (database, caching, configuration) for spam detection features
- **Performance Requirements**: Design for sub-50ms detection processing times and high accuracy (95%+ with <2% false positives)
- **Algorithm Research**: Focus on pattern-based detection suitable for Laravel environments with configurable thresholds
- **Modular Design**: Ensure spam detection integrates with the existing modular architecture and graceful degradation
- **Future Sprint Planning**: This sprint must generate complete ticket structure for Implementation, Test Implementation, and Code Cleanup phases
