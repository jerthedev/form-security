    {
        if (!$this->isRegistrationRequest($request)) {
            return $next($request);
        }
        
        // Pre-registration security checks
        $securityCheck = $this->performSecurityCheck($request);
        
        if ($securityCheck['should_block']) {
            return $this->blockRegistrationResponse($request, $securityCheck);
        }
