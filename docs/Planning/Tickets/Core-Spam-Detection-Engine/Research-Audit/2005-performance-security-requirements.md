## Title
Analyze performance requirements and security considerations for enterprise-grade spam detection

## Description
Conduct comprehensive analysis of performance requirements and security considerations for the Core Spam Detection Engine. This analysis will establish specific performance targets, security protocols, and implementation strategies to ensure the system meets enterprise-grade requirements while maintaining data protection and system integrity.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Analyze performance requirements and establish specific benchmarks
- Design security protocols for pattern storage and processing
- Plan graceful degradation strategies for system resilience
- Design monitoring and alerting systems for performance tracking
- Establish testing strategies for performance and security validation
- Plan scalability strategies for high-volume environments

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Ensures system meets Epic performance requirements (sub-50ms processing)
- Establishes security protocols for sensitive spam pattern data
- Provides resilience strategies for production environments
- Creates monitoring framework for ongoing performance optimization
- Establishes testing framework for performance validation

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: High-level performance and security requirements
- Desired: Detailed implementation strategies with specific metrics and protocols

**Dependencies:**
- Ticket 2001 (Current State Analysis) - Understanding existing performance baseline
- Ticket 2002 (Technology Research) - Performance optimization techniques
- Ticket 2003 (Architecture Design) - System architecture decisions
- Ticket 2004 (Pattern Engine Design) - Algorithm complexity analysis

**Expected outcomes:**
- Detailed performance benchmarks and testing strategies
- Security protocols for pattern data and processing
- Graceful degradation implementation plans
- Monitoring and alerting system specifications
- Scalability roadmap for high-volume deployments
