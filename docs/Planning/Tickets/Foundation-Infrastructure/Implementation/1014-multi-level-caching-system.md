**Status**: Complete

## Title
Multi-Level Caching System - Implement three-tier caching architecture with intelligent invalidation

## Description
Implement a comprehensive three-tier caching system (Request → Memory → Database) that leverages Laravel 12's enhanced caching features to achieve 90%+ cache hit ratios and 80%+ database query reduction. The system will include intelligent cache invalidation, performance monitoring, and support for distributed caching environments.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Create CacheManager service with three-tier caching architecture
- Implement request-level caching using Laravel 12's memo driver
- Set up memory caching with Redis/Memcached for high-speed access
- Build database caching layer for persistent cache storage
- Create intelligent cache invalidation system with dependency tracking
- Implement cache key management with hierarchical naming strategy
- Add cache performance monitoring and statistics collection
- Create cache warming and maintenance automation

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Enables high-performance operations with 90%+ cache hit ratios
- Reduces database load by 80%+ through strategic caching
- Supports enterprise-scale applications with distributed caching
- Provides intelligent cache management for optimal performance

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: No caching system exists - complete caching infrastructure implementation needed
- Desired: Fully functional three-tier caching system with intelligent invalidation and monitoring

**Dependencies:**
- Service provider implementation for cache service registration
- Configuration system for cache driver and TTL management
- Event system for cache invalidation coordination
