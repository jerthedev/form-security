# Model Classes & Relationships

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/1012-model-classes-relationships  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Model Classes & Relationships - Implement Eloquent models with relationships, scopes, and business logic

## Description
Implement comprehensive Eloquent model classes for all database tables with proper relationships, query scopes, business logic methods, and Laravel 12 enhanced features. This includes leveraging PHP 8.2+ features like readonly properties and enums for type safety and performance optimization.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Create Eloquent model classes for all 5 core tables
- Implement proper model relationships (BelongsTo, HasMany, etc.)
- Add query scopes for common filtering and analytics operations
- Implement business logic methods for spam scoring and risk assessment
- Leverage PHP 8.2+ features (readonly properties, enums, union types)
- Add comprehensive model casting for JSON columns and data types
- Implement model events and observers for audit trails and cache invalidation
- Create model factories for testing and development data generation

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Provides the data access layer for all package functionality
- Enables clean, maintainable code through proper ORM patterns
- Supports complex analytics queries through optimized relationships and scopes
- Ensures data integrity and business rule enforcement at the model level

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: No model classes exist - complete model layer implementation needed
- Desired: Fully functional Eloquent models with relationships, scopes, and business logic

**Dependencies:**
- Database migrations and schema implementation
- Service provider for model binding and configuration
- Laravel 12 Eloquent ORM features and PHP 8.2+ compatibility

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: Model architecture and relationship design researched
- Implementation: Develop Eloquent models, relationships, and business logic
- Test Implementation: Write tests, verify functionality, performance, relationships
- Code Cleanup: Refactor, optimize, remove technical debt (optional, only if needed)

## Notes
This ticket creates the core data access layer for the entire package. The model relationships and query scopes implemented here will be used extensively by all other package components. Performance optimization through proper eager loading and query scopes is critical.

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)
