  - **Mitigation**: Automated documentation generation, version control integration, regular review cycles

- **Risk**: Documentation complexity overwhelms new users
  - **Impact**: Poor user experience, low adoption, increased support burden
  - **Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure, clear navigation, beginner-friendly getting started guides

### Medium Risk Items
- **Risk**: Code examples become incompatible with package updates
  - **Impact**: User frustration, implementation failures, support issues
  - **Mitigation**: Automated testing of examples, version-specific documentation, update procedures

- **Risk**: Documentation hosting and maintenance costs
  - **Impact**: Budget overruns, service interruptions, maintenance burden
  - **Mitigation**: Cost-effective hosting solutions, automated deployment, community contributions

### Low Risk Items
