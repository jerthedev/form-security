## Title
External Services Integration - Third-party API integrations for enhanced detection capabilities

## Epic Overview
This Epic integrates with external services to significantly enhance the spam detection capabilities beyond pattern-based analysis. It includes IP reputation checking, geolocation analysis, AI-powered detection, and specialized services like temporary email detection.

- **Major Capability**: Enhanced detection through external service integrations (IP reputation, geolocation, AI, etc.)
- **Importance**: Significantly improves detection accuracy and provides advanced threat intelligence
- **Package Vision**: Enables enterprise-grade threat detection through multiple data sources
- **Target Users**: Organizations requiring advanced threat detection and willing to use external services
- **Key Value**: Provides sophisticated threat intelligence while maintaining graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Epic Goals & Objectives
- [ ] Integrate IP reputation checking with AbuseIPDB and local caching
- [ ] Implement geolocation analysis using MaxMind GeoLite2 database
- [ ] Create AI-powered spam analysis with configurable AI models (xAI, OpenAI, etc.)
- [ ] Develop external service integration framework for future expansions
- [ ] Implement event system for notifications and alerting
- [ ] Create specialized detection services (temporary email, etc.)

## Scope & Boundaries
### In Scope
- IP reputation system with AbuseIPDB integration and local caching
- Geolocation analysis system with MaxMind GeoLite2 integration
- AI-powered spam analysis with multiple AI model support
- External service integration framework with error handling and fallbacks
- Event system for spam detection and high-risk pattern notifications
- GeoLite2 database management and updates
- Temporary email detection service
- Service health monitoring and graceful degradation

### Out of Scope
- Core spam detection algorithms (handled in EPIC-002)
- Form validation and middleware (handled in EPIC-003)
- Database schema (handled in EPIC-001)
- Analytics dashboards (handled in EPIC-006)
- User interface components (handled in EPIC-006)

## User Stories & Use Cases
### Primary User Stories
1. **As a security-conscious developer**, I want IP reputation checking so that I can block known malicious IPs
2. **As a global application owner**, I want geolocation analysis so that I can detect suspicious geographic patterns
3. **As an enterprise user**, I want AI-powered analysis so that I can detect sophisticated spam attempts
4. **As a system administrator**, I want service health monitoring so that I can ensure reliable operation

### Secondary User Stories
1. **As a cost-conscious developer**, I want local caching so that I can minimize external API costs
2. **As a developer**, I want graceful degradation so that my application continues working when external services fail
3. **As a security analyst**, I want event notifications so that I can respond to high-risk patterns quickly

### Use Case Scenarios
- **Scenario 1**: Form submission from known malicious IP - system checks AbuseIPDB and blocks automatically
- **Scenario 2**: Registration attempt from suspicious geographic location - system flags for review
- **Scenario 3**: AI analysis detects sophisticated spam that pattern matching missed - system blocks with high confidence

## Technical Architecture Overview
**Key Components**:
- IpReputationService with AbuseIPDB integration and local caching
- GeolocationService with MaxMind GeoLite2 database integration
- AiSpamAnalysisService with configurable AI model support
- External service integration framework with circuit breaker pattern
- Event system for notifications and alerting
- Service health monitoring and status tracking
- GeoLite2 database management and update system
- Temporary email detection service

**Integration Points**:
- Core spam detection service for enhanced analysis

- [ ] PHP 8.1+ with cURL and JSON extensions
- [ ] Internet connectivity for external API access

## Risk Assessment
### High Risk Items
- **Risk**: External service outages causing application failures
  - **Impact**: Spam detection fails, forms become unusable, poor user experience
  - **Mitigation**: Circuit breaker pattern, graceful degradation, comprehensive fallback mechanisms

- **Risk**: API cost overruns from high-volume usage
  - **Impact**: Unexpected expenses, service throttling, budget issues
  - **Mitigation**: Aggressive caching, rate limiting, cost monitoring, usage alerts

### Medium Risk Items
- **Risk**: AI service accuracy varies significantly
  - **Impact**: Inconsistent spam detection, false positives/negatives
  - **Mitigation**: Confidence scoring, multiple model support, fallback to pattern detection

- **Risk**: GeoLite2 database updates causing compatibility issues
  - **Impact**: Geolocation analysis fails, detection accuracy decreases
  - **Mitigation**: Database version management, update testing, rollback procedures
