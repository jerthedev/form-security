**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/7008-feature-end-to-end-testing-requirements  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Define comprehensive feature and end-to-end testing requirements for complete workflow validation

## Description
Define detailed requirements for feature and end-to-end testing that will validate complete user workflows and real-world usage scenarios of the JTD-FormSecurity package. This analysis will ensure comprehensive validation of user-facing functionality and integration scenarios.

This requirements analysis will address:
- Feature testing for complete user workflows and scenarios
- End-to-end testing for real-world usage patterns
- Laravel package integration testing with host applications
- Multi-version compatibility testing across PHP and Laravel versions
- Installation and setup testing for new users
- Documentation testing and example validation
- Upgrade and migration testing for existing installations
- Community contribution and maintenance testing workflows

The requirements will ensure the package works reliably in real-world scenarios and provides excellent user experience.
