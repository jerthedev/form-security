- Performance profilers for optimization

## Success Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] 100% test coverage across all package components
- [ ] All tests pass consistently across PHP 8.1+ and Laravel 10.x/11.x
- [ ] Performance tests validate sub-100ms detection times
- [ ] Security tests validate protection against common vulnerabilities
- [ ] Integration tests validate compatibility with major Laravel packages

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Test suite completes in under 5 minutes for rapid feedback
- [ ] Memory usage during testing remains under 512MB
- [ ] Test reliability with 99.9%+ consistent pass rate
- [ ] Code quality scores exceed 95% on all metrics
- [ ] Security scan results show zero high/critical vulnerabilities

## Dependencies & Prerequisites
### Internal Dependencies
- [ ] All other Epics (ongoing testing as features are developed)
- [ ] Package codebase and architecture
- [ ] Development environment setup
- [ ] CI/CD infrastructure

### External Dependencies
- [ ] PHPUnit testing framework
- [ ] Laravel testing utilities
- [ ] PHP 8.1+ with required extensions
- [ ] Database systems for testing (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- [ ] External service test accounts (for integration testing)
- [ ] CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, etc.)

## Risk Assessment
### High Risk Items
- **Risk**: Test suite becomes too slow, hindering development velocity
  - **Impact**: Developers skip tests, reduced code quality, slower development
  - **Mitigation**: Test optimization, parallel execution, selective test running

- **Risk**: Achieving 100% coverage becomes time-consuming and blocks development
  - **Impact**: Delayed feature delivery, developer frustration, project timeline issues
  - **Mitigation**: Incremental coverage improvement, automated coverage tracking, pragmatic coverage goals

### Medium Risk Items
- **Risk**: External service dependencies make tests unreliable
  - **Impact**: Flaky tests, false failures, reduced confidence in test results
  - **Mitigation**: Mock services, test isolation, fallback strategies

- **Risk**: Performance tests become environment-dependent
  - **Impact**: Inconsistent results, false performance regressions, optimization challenges
  - **Mitigation**: Normalized benchmarks, multiple environment testing, statistical analysis

### Low Risk Items
- Test data management complexity
- CI/CD integration configuration challenges
- Code quality tool configuration conflicts

## Estimated Effort & Timeline
**Overall Epic Size**: Large (Ongoing throughout project - 6-8 weeks total effort)

### Phase Breakdown
- **Research/Audit Phase**: 3-4 days - Testing framework research, tool evaluation
- **Implementation Phase**: 25-30 days - Test implementation (parallel with feature development)
- **Test Implementation Phase**: 5-6 days - Testing the testing framework, CI/CD setup
