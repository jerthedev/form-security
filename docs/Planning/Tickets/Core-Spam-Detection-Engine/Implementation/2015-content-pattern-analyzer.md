# Content Pattern Analyzer Implementation

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/2015-content-pattern-analyzer  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Implement ContentPatternAnalyzer for message content spam detection

## Description
Create the ContentPatternAnalyzer component that specializes in detecting spam patterns in message content including spam keywords, suspicious links, repeated content, and linguistic analysis. This is the most complex analyzer contributing to the hybrid spam detection system.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Implement ContentPatternAnalyzer class with content-specific detection algorithms
- Create spam keyword detection with weighted keyword lists
- Implement suspicious link detection and URL analysis
- Add repeated content and template detection
- Implement basic linguistic analysis for spam characteristics
- Create content pattern scoring with confidence metrics
- Add content normalization and preprocessing logic
- Integrate Bayesian filtering for content analysis

**Dependencies:**
- Ticket 2012 (Core SpamDetectionService) - Service framework must exist
- Ticket 2011 (SpamPattern Model) - For pattern data access

**Expected outcomes:**
- Production-ready ContentPatternAnalyzer with high detection accuracy
- Spam keyword detection with contextual analysis
- URL reputation and link analysis capabilities
- Bayesian content filtering with learning capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ContentPatternAnalyzer class created implementing PatternAnalyzerContract
- [ ] Spam keyword detection implemented with weighted scoring
- [ ] Suspicious link and URL analysis implemented
- [ ] Repeated content detection implemented
- [ ] Basic linguistic analysis implemented for spam characteristics
- [ ] Bayesian filtering integration implemented
- [ ] Performance targets met: <25ms processing time per content analysis
- [ ] Accuracy targets met: 96%+ spam content detection, <2% false positives

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days) - Complex content analysis with multiple detection methods

## Dependencies
- [x] Ticket 2012 (Core SpamDetectionService) - MUST BE COMPLETED
- [x] Ticket 2011 (SpamPattern Model) - MUST BE COMPLETED
