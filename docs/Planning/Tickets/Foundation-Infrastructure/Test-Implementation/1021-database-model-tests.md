# Database & Model Tests

**Ticket ID**: Test-Implementation/1021-database-model-tests  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Database & Model Tests - Comprehensive testing for migrations, models, and database performance

## Description
Implement comprehensive test coverage for all database migrations, Eloquent models, relationships, and database performance. Tests will validate migration execution and rollback, model functionality, query performance, and data integrity across different database systems.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Create migration tests for all database tables with rollback validation
- Test all Eloquent model functionality including relationships and scopes
- Implement database performance tests for query optimization validation
- Test model factories and data generation for realistic test scenarios
- Create integration tests for complex database operations and transactions
- Validate database schema integrity and foreign key constraints
- Test chunked GeoLite2 import functionality with memory efficiency
- Implement cross-database compatibility tests (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Ensures database schema integrity and migration reliability
- Validates model functionality and relationship correctness
- Confirms performance targets for high-volume database operations
- Provides confidence in data integrity and constraint enforcement

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: No database/model tests exist - complete test implementation needed
- Desired: Comprehensive test coverage (95%+) for all database and model functionality

**Dependencies:**
- Database migrations implementation (ticket 1011)
- Model classes implementation (ticket 1012)
- PHPUnit 12 with Laravel database testing utilities

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: Database schema and model architecture researched
- Implementation: Database migrations and models implemented
- Test Implementation: Write tests, verify functionality, performance, data integrity
- Code Cleanup: Refactor, optimize, remove technical debt (optional, only if needed)

## Notes
This ticket ensures the data layer foundation is thoroughly tested and reliable. Database performance and data integrity are critical for the package's success in high-volume applications. Cross-database compatibility testing ensures broad deployment support.

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)
