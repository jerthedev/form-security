**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/7003-cicd-quality-assurance-research  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Research automated CI/CD workflows and quality assurance processes for Laravel package development

## Description
Conduct comprehensive research into modern CI/CD workflows and automated quality assurance processes specifically for Laravel package development and public package distribution via Packagist.

This research will focus on:
- GitHub Actions workflows for Laravel package testing
- Multi-version testing matrices (PHP 8.2+, Laravel 12.x)
- Database testing strategies across multiple database systems
- Automated quality gates and code quality enforcement
- Security vulnerability scanning and dependency auditing
- Package installation and compatibility testing
- Public package release automation and Packagist integration
- Performance monitoring and regression detection

The findings will inform the design of automated workflows that ensure consistent quality and enable confident public package releases.
