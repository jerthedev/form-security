# Database Schema and Migrations for Spam Detection

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/2010-database-schema-migrations  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Complete

## Title
Create database schema and migrations for spam detection system

## Description
Implement comprehensive database schema to support spam detection functionality including spam patterns, blocked submissions tracking, pattern matches, and performance analytics. This forms the data foundation for the entire spam detection system.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Design and implement spam_patterns table for pattern storage and management
- Create blocked_submissions table for tracking spam submissions and analytics
- Implement pattern_matches table for detection result logging
- Add spam_scores table for score tracking and threshold analysis
- Create proper indexes for high-performance queries under load
- Implement database migrations with rollback capabilities
- Add foreign key constraints and data integrity rules

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Provides data foundation for all spam detection functionality
- Enables pattern storage, matching, and performance analytics
- Supports high-volume form submission processing with optimized queries
- Required foundation for all subsequent implementation tickets

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: Basic Epic-001 database foundation available
- Desired: Complete spam detection database schema with optimized performance

**Dependencies:**
- Epic-001 Foundation Infrastructure completed
- Laravel 12 database foundation available

**Expected outcomes:**
- Production-ready database schema supporting 10,000+ daily submissions
- Optimized indexes for sub-20ms query performance
- Complete migration files with proper rollback support
- Database schema documentation with performance characteristics

- [x] blocked_submissions table created with columns: id, form_data_hash, spam_score, detection_method, ip_address, user_agent, blocked_at
- [x] pattern_matches table created with columns: id, submission_id, pattern_id, match_score, match_context, matched_at
- [x] spam_scores table created with columns: id, submission_hash, total_score, component_scores (JSON), threshold_used, detected_at
- [x] Proper indexes created for high-performance queries (ip_address, created_at, spam_score, pattern_type)
- [x] Foreign key constraints implemented with proper cascading rules
- [x] Migration files include proper down() methods for rollback capability
- [x] Database schema supports concurrent reads/writes under high load
- [x] Query performance targets met: <20ms for typical spam detection queries
- [x] Data integrity constraints prevent invalid data entry
- [x] Schema documentation completed with field descriptions and relationships
- [x] Migration testing validates both up and down migrations work correctly
