# EPIC-002 Core Spam Detection Engine - Implementation Roadmap

**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Epic**: EPIC-002-core-spam-detection-engine  
**Status**: Planning Complete

## Executive Summary

This roadmap synthesizes findings from Research/Audit phase tickets (2001-2005) into a comprehensive implementation plan for the Epic-002 Core Spam Detection Engine. Based on the research findings, approximately 60-70% of the foundation infrastructure is already in place from Epic-001, allowing us to focus on spam detection-specific features.

## Research Findings Summary

### Current State Analysis (Ticket 2001)
- **Infrastructure Available**: Configuration system, caching layer, database foundation, service provider pattern
- **Missing Components**: SpamDetectionService, pattern analyzers, scoring algorithms, spam-specific models
- **Integration Points**: Existing FormSecurityService, ConfigurationService, CacheService ready for spam detection extension

### Technology Stack Decisions (Ticket 2002)
- **Primary Algorithm**: Hybrid approach with Bayesian filtering (40%), Regex patterns (30%), Behavioral analysis (20%), AI analysis (10%)
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-tier with Redis, PatternCache for hot patterns, result caching for 24 hours
- **Performance Target**: Sub-50ms processing time with early exit optimization

### Architecture Design (Ticket 2003)
- **Core Service**: SpamDetectionService with pattern-based detection
- **Event System**: SpamDetected, SuspiciousActivity, PatternUpdated events
- **Database Schema**: spam_patterns, blocked_submissions, pattern_matches tables
- **Caching Integration**: PatternCache, ScoreCache, ResultCache with intelligent invalidation

### Pattern Analysis Engine (Ticket 2004)
- **Analyzer Components**: EmailPatternAnalyzer, NamePatternAnalyzer, ContentPatternAnalyzer, BehavioralPatternAnalyzer
- **Scoring System**: Weighted composite scores with confidence metrics
- **Form-Type Detection**: Registration, Contact, Comment form specialization

### Performance & Security Requirements (Ticket 2005)
- **Performance Targets**: Sub-50ms P95 processing, <20MB memory usage, 95%+ accuracy
- **Security Protocols**: ReDoS protection, input sanitization, rate limiting, encryption
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with circuit breakers, database sharding

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase Sequencing
1. **Foundation Setup** (2010-2012): Database, configuration, core service structure
2. **Core Detection Engine** (2013-2015): Pattern analyzers, scoring algorithms
3. **Integration & Features** (2016-2019): Event system, caching, advanced features

### Dependency Management
- Database and configuration must be completed before service implementation
- Core analyzers must be completed before advanced scoring
- Pattern management must be completed before caching optimization

## Resource Allocation Recommendations

### Development Team Requirements
- **Senior Laravel Developer**: Core service implementation, architecture decisions
- **Algorithm Specialist**: Pattern analyzer implementation, scoring optimization
- **QA Engineer**: Comprehensive testing, performance validation
- **DevOps Engineer**: Deployment, monitoring setup

### Timeline Estimates
- **Implementation Phase**: 4-6 weeks (assuming 2-3 developers)
- **Test Implementation Phase**: 2-3 weeks (with dedicated QA)
- **Code Cleanup Phase**: 1-2 weeks (optimization and documentation)

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance Degradation**: Early benchmarking, performance monitoring, circuit breakers
2. **False Positive Rate**: Extensive testing with real data, tunable thresholds
3. **Pattern Maintenance**: Automated pattern updates, pattern effectiveness monitoring

### Implementation Risks
1. **Complexity Underestimation**: Buffer time allocation, incremental delivery
2. **Integration Issues**: Early integration testing, Laravel component compatibility
3. **Resource Constraints**: Flexible prioritization, MVP approach for non-critical features

### Quality Risks
1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Security testing, code review, penetration testing
