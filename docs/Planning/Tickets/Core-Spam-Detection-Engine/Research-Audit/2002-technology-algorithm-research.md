**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Research spam detection algorithms, PHP libraries, and best practices for pattern-based detection systems

## Description
Conduct comprehensive research into modern spam detection technologies, algorithms, and PHP-specific implementations to inform the design of the Core Spam Detection Engine. This research will identify proven approaches, available libraries, and performance optimization techniques for building enterprise-grade spam detection in Laravel applications.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Research state-of-the-art spam detection algorithms and methodologies
- Investigate PHP libraries and packages for pattern matching and text analysis
- Study performance optimization techniques for large-scale pattern matching
- Analyze scoring algorithms and threshold management approaches
- Research caching strategies for pattern-based detection systems

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Ensures implementation uses proven, industry-standard approaches
- Identifies existing libraries that can accelerate development
- Prevents reinventing solutions that already exist
- Establishes performance benchmarks and optimization strategies
- Informs architectural decisions with real-world data

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: Limited knowledge of available PHP spam detection libraries and algorithms
- Desired: Comprehensive understanding of best practices and available tools

**Dependencies:**
- Completion of current state analysis (Ticket 2001)
- Access to research resources and documentation

**Expected outcomes:**
- Technology stack recommendations for spam detection implementation
- Performance benchmarks and optimization strategies
- Library evaluation and selection criteria
- Algorithm design recommendations based on research findings
