## Title
Service Provider & Package Registration - Implement FormSecurityServiceProvider with Laravel 12 enhanced features

## Description
Implement the core FormSecurityServiceProvider that serves as the foundation for the entire JTD-FormSecurity package. This service provider will leverage Laravel 12's enhanced service container capabilities, implement conditional service registration based on configuration flags, and establish the dependency injection patterns for all package services.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Create FormSecurityServiceProvider with Laravel 12 enhanced features
- Implement conditional service registration based on feature flags
- Set up deferred service providers for performance optimization
- Establish dependency injection container bindings for all core services
- Create package facade for clean API access
- Implement service provider bootstrapping with <50ms performance target
- Set up event-driven service coordination and configuration management

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Provides the foundational infrastructure for all other package components
- Enables modular architecture with graceful feature degradation
- Establishes performance-optimized service registration patterns
- Creates clean dependency injection patterns for testability and maintainability

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: No service provider exists - complete greenfield implementation needed
- Desired: Fully functional service provider with conditional registration and Laravel 12 optimization

**Dependencies:**
- Laravel 12 framework installation and compatibility
- PHP 8.2+ environment with required extensions
- Package directory structure and composer.json configuration

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: Architecture design and service provider patterns researched
- Implementation: Develop service provider, facades, and container bindings
- Test Implementation: Write tests, verify functionality, performance, integration
- Code Cleanup: Refactor, optimize, remove technical debt (optional, only if needed)

## Notes
This is the foundational ticket that enables all other package functionality. The service provider architecture established here will be used by all subsequent implementation tickets. Special attention must be paid to Laravel 12 compatibility and performance optimization.

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Research/Audit phase completion (tasks 1001-1007)
- [ ] Laravel 12 framework and PHP 8.2+ environment
- [ ] Package directory structure setup
