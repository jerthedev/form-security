## Title
Registration Velocity Checking - Rate limiting and velocity analysis for user registrations

## Feature Overview
This specification defines a comprehensive registration velocity checking system that monitors and controls the rate of user registrations from individual IP addresses, user sessions, and email domains. The system provides intelligent rate limiting, velocity analysis, and automated blocking to prevent mass registration attacks while maintaining a smooth experience for legitimate users.

The velocity checking system includes configurable time windows, threshold management, intelligent scoring algorithms, temporary blocking mechanisms, and comprehensive monitoring. It operates at multiple levels including IP-based, session-based, and email domain-based velocity checking with sophisticated pattern recognition capabilities.

Key capabilities include:
- Multi-dimensional velocity checking (IP, session, email domain)
- Configurable time windows and registration thresholds
- Intelligent velocity scoring with progressive penalties
- Temporary blocking with automatic expiration
- Whitelist management for trusted sources
- Pattern recognition for coordinated attack detection
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Integration with user registration enhancement system

## Purpose & Rationale
### Business Justification
- **Attack Prevention**: Prevents mass registration attacks and bot-driven account creation
- **Resource Protection**: Protects system resources from registration flooding
- **Data Quality**: Maintains high-quality user base by preventing spam account creation
- **Compliance Support**: Supports regulatory requirements for user verification and fraud prevention

### Technical Justification
- **System Stability**: Prevents system overload from high-volume registration attempts
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces database load and processing overhead from spam registrations
- **Security Enhancement**: Provides early detection and prevention of coordinated attacks
- **Scalability**: Enables system scaling by controlling registration volume
