# Caching, CLI & Integration

**Sprint ID**: 004-caching-cli-integration  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Sprint Duration**: 2025-01-27 - 2025-01-28
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Total Points**: 34  

## Sprint Goal
Implement the multi-level caching system, CLI commands, and comprehensive integration testing to complete the core functionality of the JTD-FormSecurity foundation infrastructure.

## Sprint Overview
This sprint focuses on completing the remaining core infrastructure components and establishing comprehensive integration testing. The primary deliverables include:

- **Multi-level Caching System**: Implement three-tier caching (Request → Memory → Database) with intelligent invalidation and configurable TTL
- **CLI Commands Development**: Create comprehensive CLI commands for installation, configuration, and maintenance operations
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Establish thorough test coverage for caching, CLI commands, and full system integration
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure all performance targets are met across the entire foundation infrastructure

This sprint completes the foundation infrastructure Epic by delivering the final core components and validating the entire system through comprehensive integration testing.

## AI Prompts

### 1. Next Task Determination Prompt
```
You are a Laravel package development expert working on the JTD-FormSecurity package.

TASK: Determine the next task to work on in the current sprint.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the Sprint file at: docs/Planning/Sprints/004-caching-cli-integration.md
2. Analyze the Sprint Tasks table to identify:
   - Tasks marked as complete [x]
   - Tasks currently in progress [/]
   - Tasks not yet started [ ]
3. Determine the next logical task based on:
   - Task dependencies and prerequisites (Caching → CLI → Tests → Integration)
   - Sprint phase progression (Implementation → Test Implementation)
   - Current sprint progress and priorities
4. BEFORE starting work:
   - Update the task status to [/] in the Sprint Tasks table in the Sprint file
   - Use add_tasks tool to create a detailed breakdown of the implementation work
   - Use update_tasks tool to track progress as you work
5. Once you identify the next task:
   - Open the specific ticket file listed in the File Path column
   - Read the AI Prompt section in that ticket file
   - Begin working on that task following the ticket's instructions

SPRINT CONTEXT:
- Sprint Goal: Implement the multi-level caching system, CLI commands, and comprehensive integration testing
- Current Sprint: 004-caching-cli-integration
