# Form Type Detection Architecture Research

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/3003-form-detection-architecture-research  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Research Automatic Form Type Detection Systems and Architecture Approaches

## Description
Research and design an intelligent form type detection system that can automatically identify form types (registration, contact, comment, generic) from request data. This system is critical for applying appropriate protection levels and specialized validation rules without manual configuration.

### What needs to be accomplished:
- Research automatic form type detection algorithms and approaches
- Study request analysis techniques for form identification
- Investigate pattern matching algorithms for field analysis
- Research machine learning approaches for form classification
- Design accuracy measurement and validation systems
- Study fallback mechanisms for unknown form types
- Research performance optimization for real-time detection

### Why this work is necessary:
- Enables automatic protection without manual form type configuration
- Allows specialized rules to be applied based on detected form type
- Critical for global middleware to apply appropriate protection levels
- Reduces developer configuration burden
- Improves user experience through intelligent protection

### Current state vs desired state:
- **Current**: No automatic form detection system exists
- **Desired**: Intelligent system with 90%+ accuracy for common form types
- **Gap**: Need comprehensive research and architecture design

```

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: 
  - Gather requirements
  - Search latest information about APIs and development practices including how other developers have solved similar problems using Brave Search MCP
  - Analyze existing code, plan implementation
  - Generate tickets for Implementation, Test Implementation, and Code Cleanup based on findings
- Implementation: Develop new features, update documentation
- Test Implementation: Write tests, verify functionality, performance, security
- Code Cleanup: Refactor, optimize, remove technical debt (optional, only if needed)

## Notes
Form type detection is critical for:
- Global middleware applying appropriate protection levels
- Specialized validation rules being automatically selected
- Reducing developer configuration burden
- Improving protection accuracy through context-aware analysis

Key considerations:
- Must achieve 90%+ accuracy for common form types
- Must process in real-time with minimal performance impact
- Must handle edge cases and unknown form types gracefully
- Must be extensible for custom form types
- Must integrate seamlessly with validation and middleware systems

Research focus areas:
- Field name pattern analysis
- Field combination heuristics
- Route pattern analysis
- Content analysis techniques
- Machine learning classification approaches
- Performance optimization strategies

## Estimated Effort
Large (10-12 hours)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Understanding of common form types and patterns
- [ ] Access to form data samples for analysis
- [ ] Brave Search access for algorithm research
- [ ] Integration requirements from validation rules and middleware
