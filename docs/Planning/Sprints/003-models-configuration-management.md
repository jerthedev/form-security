# Models & Configuration Management

**Sprint ID**: 003-models-configuration-management  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Sprint Duration**: [Start Date] - [End Date]  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Total Points**: 21

## Sprint Goal
Implement the model layer and configuration management system for JTD-FormSecurity, building upon the foundation infrastructure to provide robust data models and flexible configuration capabilities.

## Sprint Overview
This sprint focuses on developing the core model classes and configuration management system that will power the JTD-FormSecurity package. The primary deliverables include:

- **Model Classes & Relationships**: Implement all core Eloquent models with proper relationships, scopes, and business logic
- **Configuration Management System**: Create a flexible, modular configuration system with feature toggles and runtime updates
- **Testing Coverage**: Establish comprehensive test coverage for both model functionality and configuration management
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure efficient model queries and configuration caching

This sprint builds directly on the database foundation established in Sprint 002 and provides the data layer that all other package features will depend on.

## AI Prompts

### 1. Next Task Determination Prompt
```
You are a Laravel package development expert working on the JTD-FormSecurity package.

TASK: Determine the next task to work on in the current sprint.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the Sprint file at: docs/Planning/Sprints/003-models-configuration-management.md
2. Analyze the Sprint Tasks table to identify:
   - Tasks marked as complete [x]
   - Tasks currently in progress [/]
   - Tasks not yet started [ ]
3. Determine the next logical task based on:
   - Task dependencies and prerequisites (Models → Configuration → Tests)
   - Sprint phase progression (Implementation → Test Implementation)
   - Current sprint progress and priorities
4. BEFORE starting work:
   - Update the task status to [/] in the Sprint Tasks table in the Sprint file
   - Use add_tasks tool to create a detailed breakdown of the implementation work
   - Use update_tasks tool to track progress as you work
5. Once you identify the next task:
   - Open the specific ticket file listed in the File Path column
   - Read the AI Prompt section in that ticket file
   - Begin working on that task following the ticket's instructions

SPRINT CONTEXT:
- Sprint Goal: Implement the model layer and configuration management system for JTD-FormSecurity
- Current Sprint: 003-models-configuration-management
- Sprint File Path: docs/Planning/Sprints/003-models-configuration-management.md

Please start by reading the sprint file and determining the next task to work on.
```

### 2. Task Completion Validation Prompt
```
You are a Laravel package development expert responsible for validating task completion in the JTD-FormSecurity package.

TASK: Validate that the most recently worked on task has been completed successfully.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the Sprint file at: docs/Planning/Sprints/003-models-configuration-management.md
2. Identify the last task that was marked as in progress [/] or recently completed
3. Open the specific ticket file for that task
4. Review the Acceptance Criteria section in the ticket file
5. For each acceptance criterion:
   - Verify if the criterion has been met
   - Check related code, tests, and documentation
   - Run any applicable tests to validate functionality
   - Mark completed criteria with [x] in the ticket file
6. If ALL acceptance criteria are met:
   - Mark the task as Complete [x] in the Sprint Tasks table
