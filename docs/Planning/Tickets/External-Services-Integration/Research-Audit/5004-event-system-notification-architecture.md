# Event System and Notification Architecture

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/5004-event-system-notification-architecture  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Design Event-Driven Architecture for External Service Notifications and Alerting

## Description
Design a comprehensive event-driven architecture for JTD-FormSecurity that handles external service responses, high-risk pattern detection, service health changes, and notification delivery. The system must provide reliable event processing, flexible notification routing, and integration with external notification services while maintaining package performance.

This design will include:
- Event system architecture for external service responses and detections
- High-risk pattern detection events with configurable thresholds and triggers
- Service health monitoring events for external service status changes
- Notification routing system with multiple delivery channels (email, Slack, webhooks)
- Event-driven integration with external notification services
- Asynchronous event processing using Laravel queues for performance
- Event persistence and replay capabilities for reliability
- Notification template system for customizable alert messages
- Rate limiting and throttling for notification delivery
- Event aggregation and batching for high-volume scenarios
- Integration with existing Laravel event system and listeners
- Configuration management for notification settings and routing rules

The architecture will support real-time alerting for security threats, service outages, and high-risk patterns while providing flexible configuration for different deployment scenarios and notification preferences.

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel package development expert specializing in event-driven architecture and notification systems. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/External-Services-Integration/Research-Audit/5004-event-system-notification-architecture.md

CONTEXT:
- Package: JTD-FormSecurity - Laravel form security and spam prevention
- Epic: EPIC-005 External Services Integration
- Focus: Design event-driven architecture for notifications and alerting

ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Event system for external service responses and detections
2. High-risk pattern detection events with configurable triggers
3. Service health monitoring events for status changes
4. Multi-channel notification routing (email, Slack, webhooks)
5. Asynchronous event processing using Laravel queues
6. Event persistence and replay capabilities
7. Notification template system for customizable messages
8. Rate limiting and throttling for notification delivery
9. Event aggregation and batching for high-volume scenarios
10. Integration with existing Laravel event system

DESIGN DELIVERABLES:
1. Complete event system architecture and flow diagrams
2. Event class definitions and data structures
3. Notification routing and delivery system design
4. Integration patterns with external notification services
5. Asynchronous processing and queue configuration
6. Configuration management for notification settings
7. Performance optimization and error handling strategies
8. Security framework for notification data protection

Design a Laravel-native event system that provides reliable, performant, and flexible notification capabilities for external service integration scenarios.
```

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: Design event-driven architecture for notifications and alerting
- Implementation: Implement event classes, listeners, and notification delivery system
- Test Implementation: Test event processing, notification delivery, and error handling
- Code Cleanup: Optimize event system performance and refine notification logic

## Notes
This event system design is crucial for EPIC-005 and must address:
- **Real-time Alerting**: Immediate notification of security threats and service issues
- **Reliability**: Event persistence and replay for guaranteed delivery
- **Performance**: Asynchronous processing to avoid blocking form submissions
- **Flexibility**: Configurable notification channels and routing rules
- **Scalability**: Event aggregation and batching for high-volume scenarios
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Laravel event system

The design should complement the external service integration framework (ticket 5003) and provide the notification infrastructure needed for service health monitoring, threat detection, and operational alerting.

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-8 hours) - Event system design with notification routing and delivery

## Dependencies
- [ ] 5001-current-state-analysis - Understanding of existing event system capabilities
- [ ] 5003-integration-framework-architecture-design - Framework integration points
- [ ] Laravel event system and queue infrastructure
- [ ] External notification service APIs and integration requirements
