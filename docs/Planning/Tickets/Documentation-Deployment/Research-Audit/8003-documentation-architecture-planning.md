# Documentation Architecture Planning

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/8003-documentation-architecture-planning  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Design documentation site architecture, navigation, and user experience structure

## Description
Design the comprehensive architecture for the JTD-FormSecurity documentation system, including site structure, navigation hierarchy, user journey mapping, and responsive design planning. This architecture will ensure optimal user experience while meeting all performance and accessibility requirements from EPIC-008.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Design documentation site information architecture and navigation structure
- Plan user journey mapping for different user types (new users, experienced developers, administrators)
- Create responsive design framework for mobile and desktop experiences
- Design API documentation integration with user guides
- Plan version management and multi-version documentation structure
- Design search functionality and content organization

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Ensures intuitive navigation and user experience
- Prevents information architecture problems that are costly to fix later
- Establishes foundation for content creation and organization
- Ensures accessibility and performance requirements can be met
- Provides blueprint for implementation phase

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: No defined documentation architecture or user experience design
- Desired: Complete architectural blueprint ready for implementation

**Dependencies:**
- Completion of 8001-current-state-documentation-analysis
- Completion of 8002-documentation-technology-stack-research
- EPIC-008 user stories and success criteria

**Expected outcomes:**
- Complete site architecture and navigation design
- User journey maps for all user types
- Responsive design framework and mobile strategy
- Content organization and categorization system

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel package development expert specializing in documentation architecture and user experience design. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Documentation-Deployment/Research-Audit/8003-documentation-architecture-planning.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

TICKET DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
- Template: docs/Planning/Tickets/template.md
- Major Features: Epics defined in docs/Planning/Epics/
- Phases: Research/Audit, Implementation, Test Implementation, Code Cleanup
- Format: docs/Planning/Tickets/<Major Feature>/<Phase>/####-short-description.md
- Numbering: 8000s for EPIC-008 Documentation & Deployment

Based on this ticket:
1. Design comprehensive information architecture for JTD-FormSecurity documentation
2. Create user journey maps for different user types and experience levels
3. Plan progressive disclosure strategy to manage complexity without overwhelming users
4. Design responsive, mobile-first architecture meeting performance requirements
5. Plan API documentation integration with user guides and practical examples
6. Design search and navigation systems for optimal user experience
7. Create version management strategy for multi-version documentation support
8. Plan accessibility compliance and SEO optimization strategies

Please consider Laravel community documentation standards, public package best practices, and the specific user stories from EPIC-008.
```

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: 
  - Gather requirements
  - Search latest information about APIs and development practices including how other developers have solved similar problems using Brave Search MCP
  - Analyze existing code, plan implementation
  - Generate tickets for Implementation, Test Implementation, and Code Cleanup based on findings
- Implementation: Develop new features, update documentation
- Test Implementation: Write tests, verify functionality, performance, security
- Code Cleanup: Refactor, optimize, remove technical debt (optional, only if needed)

## Notes
This architecture planning is crucial for creating a documentation system that serves all user types effectively. Key considerations:
- Laravel developers expect certain documentation patterns and structures
- Public packages need clear getting started guides and comprehensive API references
- Progressive disclosure prevents overwhelming new users while providing depth for experienced developers
- Mobile-first design is essential for modern documentation accessibility
- Search functionality must be fast and relevant to meet user expectations

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] 8001-current-state-documentation-analysis - Understanding of current state and gaps
- [ ] 8002-documentation-technology-stack-research - Technology capabilities and constraints
- [ ] EPIC-008 user stories and success criteria
