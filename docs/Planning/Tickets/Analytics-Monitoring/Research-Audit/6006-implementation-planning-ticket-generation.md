# Implementation Planning & Ticket Generation - Analytics & Monitoring

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/6006-implementation-planning-ticket-generation  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Plan implementation sequence and generate Implementation, Test Implementation, and Code Cleanup tickets

## Description
Based on the comprehensive research and analysis from previous Research/Audit tickets, plan the complete implementation sequence for EPIC-006 Analytics & Monitoring and generate all subsequent phase tickets. This includes creating detailed Implementation tickets, Test Implementation tickets, and Code Cleanup tickets with proper dependencies and sequencing.

**Implementation Planning Tasks:**
- Analyze findings from all Research/Audit tickets (6001-6005)
- Design implementation sequence with proper dependency management
- Break down Epic requirements into implementable development tasks
- Plan integration testing strategy for analytics and monitoring components
- Design code cleanup and optimization tasks
- Create comprehensive ticket set for all remaining phases

**Ticket Generation Requirements:**
- Create Implementation phase tickets (6010-6019 range)
- Create Test Implementation phase tickets (6020-6029 range)  
- Create Code Cleanup phase tickets (6030-6039 range, if needed)
- Ensure proper dependency chains between tickets
- Include detailed acceptance criteria and AI prompts for each ticket
- Plan for performance testing and optimization

**Implementation Sequence Planning:**
- Core analytics services implementation
- Monitoring and alerting system implementation
- Dashboard and reporting system implementation
- Integration and configuration implementation
- Performance optimization and testing
- Documentation and cleanup

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: Generate tickets for Implementation, Test Implementation, and Code Cleanup based on findings

## Notes
This ticket completes the Research/Audit phase and sets up the foundation for successful Epic execution. Key considerations:

**Implementation Priorities:**
1. Core analytics services (data collection and processing)
2. Monitoring and alerting system
3. Dashboard and reporting capabilities
4. Integration and configuration
5. Performance optimization

**Risk Mitigation:**
