# Specialized Validation Rules Specification

**Spec ID**: SPEC-006-specialized-validation-rules  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: High

## Title
Specialized Validation Rules - Form-specific rules (UserRegistrationSpamRule, ContactFormSpamRule, etc.)

## Feature Overview
This specification defines specialized Laravel validation rules that provide enhanced, form-specific spam protection beyond the universal SpamValidationRule. These specialized rules are optimized for specific form types and include additional checks, analysis methods, and configuration options tailored to the unique characteristics and requirements of each form type.

The specialized rules build upon the foundation of the universal rule while adding form-specific features such as velocity checking for registrations, content analysis for contact forms, comment-specific patterns, and newsletter subscription validation. Each rule provides enhanced configuration options and specialized error handling.

Key specialized rules include:
- UserRegistrationSpamRule: Enhanced registration protection with velocity checking and temporary email blocking
- ContactFormSpamRule: Message content analysis with promotional keyword detection
- CommentSpamRule: Comment-specific pattern analysis and user behavior tracking
- NewsletterSpamRule: Email-focused validation with subscription pattern analysis
- CustomFormSpamRule: Extensible rule for custom form types

## Purpose & Rationale
### Business Justification
- **Enhanced Protection**: Form-specific rules provide more accurate spam detection for specialized use cases
- **Reduced False Positives**: Tailored analysis reduces false positives by understanding form context
- **Improved User Experience**: Specialized error messages and handling improve user experience
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated handling of form-specific spam patterns reduces manual moderation

### Technical Justification
- **Specialized Analysis**: Each form type has unique spam patterns that require specialized detection methods
- **Performance Optimization**: Form-specific rules can optimize analysis for their particular use case
- **Extensibility**: Specialized rules provide extension points for custom form types
- **Maintainability**: Separation of concerns makes rules easier to maintain and test
