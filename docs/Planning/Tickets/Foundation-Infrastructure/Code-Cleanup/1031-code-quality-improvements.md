- Implement static analysis tools (PHPStan, Psalm) with strict configuration
- Add comprehensive code formatting and linting with Laravel Pint
- Create developer documentation and contribution guidelines
- Implement automated code quality checks in development workflow
- Add IDE configuration files for consistent development environment
- Create code review checklists and quality standards documentation

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Ensures long-term maintainability and sustainability of the codebase
- Improves developer experience and reduces onboarding time
- Establishes quality standards for future development
- Enables automated quality assurance and continuous improvement

**Current state vs desired state:**
