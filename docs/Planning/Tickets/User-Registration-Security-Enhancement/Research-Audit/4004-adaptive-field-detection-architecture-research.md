**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Research Adaptive Field Detection Architecture for Flexible Registration Form Analysis

## Description
Conduct comprehensive research on adaptive field detection architectures that can automatically identify and analyze registration form fields regardless of form structure, field names, or layout. This research will inform the design of a flexible system that works with 95%+ of registration form structures without requiring manual configuration.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Research adaptive field detection algorithms and pattern recognition techniques
- Investigate dynamic form field mapping and analysis strategies
- Analyze configuration approaches for different form layouts and structures
- Study integration patterns with existing spam detection algorithms
- Research performance optimization techniques for dynamic field analysis
- Investigate extensibility patterns for custom form structures and field types
- Analyze machine learning approaches for field type identification

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Registration forms vary significantly across different applications
- Manual configuration for each form structure is not scalable
- Need automatic detection that works with custom field names and layouts
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing spam detection algorithms
- Performance optimization is crucial for real-time form analysis

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: Static field detection requiring manual configuration
- Desired: Adaptive system that automatically detects and analyzes any registration form structure

**Dependencies:**
- Existing spam detection service architecture
- Form field analysis algorithms
- Performance benchmarking requirements
- Integration with validation rule system

**Expected outcomes:**
- Comprehensive research report on adaptive field detection approaches
- Architecture design for flexible form analysis system
- Performance optimization strategies for dynamic field detection
- Integration approach with existing spam detection services
- Extensibility framework for custom form structures
