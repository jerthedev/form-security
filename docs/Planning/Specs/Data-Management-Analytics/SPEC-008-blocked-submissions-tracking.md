## Title
Blocked Submissions Tracking System - Comprehensive logging and storage of all blocked form submissions

## Feature Overview
This specification defines a comprehensive tracking system for all blocked form submissions within the JTD-FormSecurity package. The system captures detailed metadata about blocked submissions including form data, user information, geolocation data, spam analysis results, and request context. This data serves multiple purposes: security analysis, pattern recognition, compliance reporting, and system optimization.

The tracking system is designed to balance comprehensive data collection with privacy considerations, storing sanitized form data while maintaining enough detail for effective analysis. The system includes automated data retention policies, efficient querying capabilities, and integration with analytics and reporting systems.

Key capabilities include:
- Comprehensive blocked submission logging with detailed metadata
- Sanitized form data storage with privacy protection
- Geolocation and IP reputation data integration
- Spam analysis results and AI confidence tracking
- Request context and session information capture
- Efficient querying and analytics support
- Automated data retention and cleanup policies

### API Specifications

#### Submission Logging Service
```php
interface SubmissionLoggerInterface
{
    public function logBlockedSubmission(
        string $formType,
        array $formData,
        array $spamAnalysis,
        Request $request,
        ?User $user = null
    ): BlockedSubmission;
    
    public function logWithGeolocation(
        string $formType,
        array $formData,
        array $spamAnalysis,

    ): BlockedSubmission;
    
    public function bulkLog(array $submissions): Collection;
}

// Usage example
$blockedSubmission = app(SubmissionLoggerInterface::class)->logBlockedSubmission(
    formType: 'contact',
    formData: $request->all(),
    spamAnalysis: $spamAnalysis,
    request: $request,
    user: auth()->user()
);
```

#### Query Scopes and Analytics
```php
// Model scopes for efficient querying
public function scopeByFormType(Builder $query, string $type): Builder;
public function scopeHighRisk(Builder $query, int $threshold = 80): Builder;
public function scopeRecentBlocks(Builder $query, int $hours = 24): Builder;
public function scopeFromCountry(Builder $query, string $countryCode): Builder;
public function scopeWithAiAnalysis(Builder $query): Builder;
public function scopeBySpamScore(Builder $query, int $min, int $max): Builder;

// Analytics queries
$recentBlocks = BlockedSubmission::recentBlocks(24)->count();
$highRiskSubmissions = BlockedSubmission::highRisk(90)->get();
$contactFormBlocks = BlockedSubmission::byFormType('contact')->get();
$aiAnalyzedBlocks = BlockedSubmission::withAiAnalysis()->get();
