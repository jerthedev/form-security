# CLI Command Tests

**Ticket ID**: Test-Implementation/1024-cli-command-tests  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Complete

## Title
CLI Command Tests - Comprehensive testing for command suite and user experience

## Description
Implement comprehensive test coverage for all CLI commands including installation, maintenance, diagnostics, and analytics commands. Tests will validate command functionality, user experience, error handling, and Laravel 12 console features integration.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Create unit tests for all CLI command classes and functionality
- Test command user experience including prompts, progress bars, and output formatting
- Implement integration tests for complete command workflows
- Test error handling, recovery procedures, and rollback functionality
- Create performance tests for command execution times and resource usage
- Test command isolation and concurrent execution prevention
- Implement output validation tests for tables, reports, and formatting
- Test interactive prompts and user input validation

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Ensures reliable command functionality across different environments
- Validates excellent user experience through comprehensive UX testing
- Confirms error handling and recovery procedures work correctly
- Provides confidence in command performance and resource management

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: No CLI command tests exist - complete test implementation needed
- Desired: Comprehensive test coverage (95%+) for all command functionality

**Dependencies:**
- CLI commands implementation (ticket 1015)
- Laravel 12 console testing utilities
- All underlying systems (database, caching, configuration) for command functionality
