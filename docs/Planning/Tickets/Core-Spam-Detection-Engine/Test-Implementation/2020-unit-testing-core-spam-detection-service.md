# Unit Testing for Core SpamDetectionService

**Ticket ID**: Test-Implementation/2020-unit-testing-core-spam-detection-service  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Comprehensive unit testing for SpamDetectionService and core components

## Description
Create comprehensive unit tests for the SpamDetectionService and its core components including all contract methods, score calculation, pattern matching, and error handling scenarios.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Create unit tests for all SpamDetectionService public methods
- Test all contract method implementations with various input scenarios
- Implement mock-based testing for external dependencies
- Create performance tests for response time validation
- Test error handling and edge cases thoroughly
- Implement data-driven tests with comprehensive test datasets
- Add memory usage and resource consumption tests
- Create integration tests with mocked analyzers

**Dependencies:**
- Ticket 2012 (Core SpamDetectionService) - Service must be implemented
- All analyzer implementations (2013-2016) - For integration testing

**Expected outcomes:**
- 95%+ code coverage for SpamDetectionService
- Comprehensive test suite validating all contract methods
- Performance validation ensuring <50ms response times
- Thorough error handling and edge case coverage

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests created for all SpamDetectionService public methods
- [ ] analyzeSpam() method thoroughly tested with various input scenarios
- [ ] calculateSpamScore() method tested with edge cases and boundary values
- [ ] checkSpamPatterns() method tested with pattern matching scenarios
- [ ] checkRateLimit() method tested with rate limiting logic
- [ ] updateSpamPatterns() method tested with pattern management
- [ ] getDetectionStats() method tested with analytics collection
- [ ] Mock-based testing implemented for external dependencies
- [ ] Performance tests validate <50ms response time requirements
- [ ] Error handling tests cover all exception scenarios
- [ ] Memory usage tests validate <20MB per operation constraint
- [ ] Data-driven tests implemented with comprehensive datasets
- [ ] Test coverage achieves 95%+ for SpamDetectionService
- [ ] Integration tests with mocked analyzers implemented

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-8 hours) - Comprehensive unit testing with performance validation

## Dependencies
- [x] Ticket 2012 (Core SpamDetectionService) - MUST BE COMPLETED
- [x] Tickets 2013-2016 (Pattern Analyzers) - MUST BE COMPLETED
