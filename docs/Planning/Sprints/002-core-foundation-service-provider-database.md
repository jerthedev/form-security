# Core Foundation - Service Provider & Database Infrastructure

**Sprint ID**: 002-core-foundation-service-provider-database  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Sprint Duration**: [Start Date] - [End Date]  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Total Points**: 29

## Sprint Goal
Establish the core foundation infrastructure for JTD-FormSecurity by implementing the service provider architecture and database layer with comprehensive testing, enabling all subsequent package functionality.

## Sprint Overview
This sprint focuses on building the fundamental infrastructure components that serve as the foundation for the entire JTD-FormSecurity package. The primary deliverables include:

- **Service Provider Architecture**: Implement FormSecurityServiceProvider with Laravel 12 enhanced features, conditional service registration, and deferred providers for optimal performance
- **Database Infrastructure**: Create comprehensive database migrations, schema design, and foundational data structures
- **Testing Foundation**: Establish comprehensive test coverage for both service provider and database components
- **Performance Targets**: Achieve <50ms service provider bootstrap and optimized database query performance

This sprint establishes the critical infrastructure that all other Epic components depend on, making it essential for the success of subsequent development phases.

   - Current sprint progress and priorities
4. BEFORE starting work:
   - Update the task status to [/] in the Sprint Tasks table in the Sprint file
   - Use add_tasks tool to create a detailed breakdown of the implementation work
   - Use update_tasks tool to track progress as you work
5. Once you identify the next task:
   - Open the specific ticket file listed in the File Path column
   - Read the AI Prompt section in that ticket file
   - Begin working on that task following the ticket's instructions

SPRINT CONTEXT:
