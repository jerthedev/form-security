# Testing Architecture Design - Quality Assurance & Testing Framework

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/7004-testing-architecture-design  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Design comprehensive testing architecture and organization strategy for JTD-FormSecurity package

## Description
Design a comprehensive testing architecture that organizes tests efficiently, enables 100% code coverage, and supports the Epic's performance and quality requirements. This architecture will serve as the blueprint for implementing the complete testing framework.

This design will address:
- Test suite organization (Unit, Feature, Integration, Performance)
- PHPUnit 12.x attribute-based test grouping strategy
- Test data management and factory design patterns
- Mock service strategies for external API dependencies
- Database testing approaches and environment management
- Test execution optimization for sub-5-minute completion
- Memory usage optimization for <512MB requirement
- Coverage reporting and analysis integration
- Test environment configuration and isolation

The architecture will ensure scalable, maintainable, and efficient testing that supports rapid development while maintaining quality.
