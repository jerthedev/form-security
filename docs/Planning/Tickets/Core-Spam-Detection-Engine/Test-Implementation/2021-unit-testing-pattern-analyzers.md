# Unit Testing for Pattern Analyzers

**Ticket ID**: Test-Implementation/2021-unit-testing-pattern-analyzers  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Comprehensive unit testing for all pattern analyzer implementations

## Description
Create comprehensive unit tests for all pattern analyzers (Email, Name, Content, Behavioral) including algorithm validation, accuracy testing, performance validation, and edge case handling.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Create unit tests for EmailPatternAnalyzer with disposable email detection
- Implement tests for NamePatternAnalyzer with fake name detection
- Create comprehensive tests for ContentPatternAnalyzer with spam content detection
- Implement tests for BehavioralPatternAnalyzer with behavior analysis
- Test analyzer accuracy with real-world datasets
- Create performance tests for analyzer response times
- Implement edge case and error handling tests
- Add analyzer configuration and threshold testing

**Dependencies:**
- Tickets 2013-2016 (All Pattern Analyzers) - Analyzers must be implemented

**Expected outcomes:**
- 95%+ code coverage for all pattern analyzers
- Accuracy validation meeting specified targets per analyzer
- Performance validation for analyzer response times
- Comprehensive edge case and error handling coverage

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] EmailPatternAnalyzer unit tests implemented with 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Disposable email detection accuracy tested (98%+ target)
- [ ] Domain reputation testing implemented with whitelist/blacklist scenarios
- [ ] NamePatternAnalyzer unit tests implemented with 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Fake name detection accuracy tested (95%+ target)
- [ ] Cultural name pattern testing implemented
- [ ] ContentPatternAnalyzer unit tests implemented with 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Spam keyword detection accuracy tested (96%+ target)
- [ ] URL analysis and Bayesian filtering tested
- [ ] BehavioralPatternAnalyzer unit tests implemented with 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Bot behavior detection accuracy tested (94%+ target)
- [ ] Velocity and rate limiting analysis tested
- [ ] Performance tests validate analyzer-specific response times
- [ ] Edge case and error handling tests comprehensive
- [ ] Configuration and threshold testing implemented
- [ ] Real-world dataset testing validates accuracy targets

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days) - Comprehensive testing for multiple complex analyzers

## Dependencies
- [x] Tickets 2013-2016 (All Pattern Analyzers) - MUST BE COMPLETED
