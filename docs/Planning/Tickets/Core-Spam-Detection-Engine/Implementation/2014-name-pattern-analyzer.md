# Name Pattern Analyzer Implementation

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/2014-name-pattern-analyzer  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Implement NamePatternAnalyzer for suspicious name pattern detection

## Description
Create the NamePatternAnalyzer component that specializes in detecting spam patterns in name fields including fake names, random character sequences, suspicious patterns, and name validation. This analyzer contributes to the hybrid spam detection system with name-focused algorithms.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Implement NamePatternAnalyzer class with name-specific detection algorithms
- Create fake name detection using common spam name patterns
- Implement random character sequence detection for generated names
- Add suspicious pattern matching (repeated characters, numeric patterns)
- Implement name validation and normalization logic
- Create name pattern scoring with confidence metrics
- Add cultural name pattern recognition for international support
- Integrate with pattern caching system for performance optimization

**Dependencies:**
- Ticket 2012 (Core SpamDetectionService) - Service framework must exist
- Ticket 2011 (SpamPattern Model) - For pattern data access

**Expected outcomes:**
- Production-ready NamePatternAnalyzer with high detection accuracy
- Fake name detection with 95%+ accuracy
- Cultural awareness for international name validation
- Performance-optimized name analysis with caching

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] NamePatternAnalyzer class created implementing PatternAnalyzerContract
- [ ] Fake name detection implemented with comprehensive pattern matching
- [ ] Random character sequence detection implemented
- [ ] Suspicious pattern matching implemented (repeated chars, numbers)
- [ ] Name validation and normalization implemented
- [ ] Cultural name pattern support implemented for international names
- [ ] Performance targets met: <10ms processing time per name
- [ ] Accuracy targets met: 95%+ fake name detection, <3% false positives

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-8 hours)

## Dependencies
- [x] Ticket 2012 (Core SpamDetectionService) - MUST BE COMPLETED
- [x] Ticket 2011 (SpamPattern Model) - MUST BE COMPLETED
