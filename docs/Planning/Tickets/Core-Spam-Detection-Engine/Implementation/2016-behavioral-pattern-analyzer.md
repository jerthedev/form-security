# Behavioral Pattern Analyzer Implementation

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/2016-behavioral-pattern-analyzer  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Implement BehavioralPatternAnalyzer for submission behavior analysis

## Description
Create the BehavioralPatternAnalyzer component that analyzes submission behavior patterns including submission timing, IP patterns, user agent analysis, and form interaction patterns. This analyzer provides behavioral intelligence to the hybrid spam detection system.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Implement BehavioralPatternAnalyzer class with behavior-specific algorithms
- Create submission timing analysis for rapid-fire detection
- Implement IP pattern analysis and geolocation correlation
- Add user agent analysis for bot detection
- Create form interaction pattern analysis
- Implement session behavior tracking
- Add rate limiting and velocity analysis
- Integrate with geolocation services for anomaly detection

**Dependencies:**
- Ticket 2012 (Core SpamDetectionService) - Service framework must exist
- Epic-001 GeolocationService - For IP analysis

**Expected outcomes:**
- Production-ready BehavioralPatternAnalyzer with behavior intelligence
- Rapid submission detection with velocity analysis
- IP and geolocation anomaly detection
- Bot behavior detection through user agent analysis

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] BehavioralPatternAnalyzer class created implementing PatternAnalyzerContract
- [ ] Submission timing analysis implemented with velocity detection
- [ ] IP pattern analysis implemented with geolocation correlation
- [ ] User agent analysis implemented for bot detection
- [ ] Form interaction pattern analysis implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting and velocity analysis implemented
- [ ] Performance targets met: <20ms processing time per behavior analysis
- [ ] Accuracy targets met: 94%+ bot detection, <5% false positives

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days) - Complex behavioral analysis with multiple data sources

## Dependencies
- [x] Ticket 2012 (Core SpamDetectionService) - MUST BE COMPLETED
- [x] Epic-001 GeolocationService - Available for IP analysis
