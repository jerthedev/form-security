# Integration Tests

**Ticket ID**: Test-Implementation/1025-integration-tests  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Integration Tests - End-to-end testing for complete foundation infrastructure

## Description
Implement comprehensive integration tests that validate the complete foundation infrastructure working together as a cohesive system. Tests will cover full package installation, service integration, data flow, performance under load, and real-world usage scenarios.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Create end-to-end integration tests for complete package functionality
- Test full package installation and configuration workflow
- Implement load testing for high-volume scenarios (10,000+ submissions/day)
- Test service integration and dependency coordination
- Create real-world usage scenario tests with realistic data
- Test package compatibility with different Laravel applications
- Implement performance integration tests validating all targets
- Test graceful degradation scenarios with service failures

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Validates complete system functionality under realistic conditions
- Ensures all components work together correctly and efficiently
- Confirms performance targets are met in integrated scenarios
- Provides confidence in real-world deployment scenarios

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: No integration tests exist - complete integration test implementation needed
- Desired: Comprehensive integration test coverage validating complete system functionality

**Dependencies:**
- All implementation tickets completed (1010-1015)
- All unit test tickets completed (1020-1024)
- Complete testing environment with all dependencies
