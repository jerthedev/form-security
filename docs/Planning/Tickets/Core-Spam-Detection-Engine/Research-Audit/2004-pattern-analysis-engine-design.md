# Pattern Analysis Engine Design - Specialized Detection Algorithms

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/2004-pattern-analysis-engine-design  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Design specialized pattern analysis engines for names, emails, content, and behavioral detection

## Description
Design comprehensive pattern analysis engines that form the core intelligence of the spam detection system. This includes specialized analyzers for different data types (names, emails, messages, URLs), scoring algorithms with configurable weights, and form-type-specific detection strategies. The design must support 10,000+ patterns while maintaining sub-50ms processing times.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Design NamePatternAnalyzer for detecting spam patterns in user names
- Design EmailPatternAnalyzer for email address and domain analysis
- Design ContentPatternAnalyzer for message and content analysis
- Design BehavioralPatternAnalyzer for submission pattern detection
- Design scoring algorithm with weighted indicators and confidence scoring
- Design form-type-specific detection strategies and threshold management

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Provides the core intelligence that differentiates the package from basic validation
- Ensures accurate spam detection with minimal false positives
- Enables form-specific optimization for different use cases
- Establishes foundation for adaptive learning and pattern updates
- Creates extensible architecture for future detection methods

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: High-level pattern detection concepts without specific algorithms
- Desired: Detailed algorithm specifications ready for implementation

**Dependencies:**
- Ticket 2001 (Current State Analysis) - Understanding existing patterns
- Ticket 2002 (Technology Research) - Algorithm and library decisions
- Ticket 2003 (Architecture Design) - Overall system architecture
- Pattern database design and seeding strategy

**Expected outcomes:**
- Detailed specifications for each pattern analyzer
- Scoring algorithm mathematical models and implementation plans
- Pattern database structure and management strategies
- Performance optimization techniques for large pattern sets
- Testing strategies for accuracy and performance validation
