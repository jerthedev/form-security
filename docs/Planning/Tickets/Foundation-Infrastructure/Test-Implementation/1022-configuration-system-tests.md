# Configuration System Tests

**Ticket ID**: Test-Implementation/1022-configuration-system-tests  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Configuration System Tests - Comprehensive testing for configuration management and validation

## Description
Implement comprehensive test coverage for the configuration management system including hierarchical configuration loading, feature toggles, validation engine, runtime updates, and security features. Tests will validate configuration integrity, performance targets, and graceful degradation scenarios.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Create unit tests for ConfigurationManager with hierarchical loading
- Test feature toggle system with graceful degradation scenarios
- Implement configuration validation engine tests with business rules
- Test runtime configuration updates without application restart
- Create security tests for sensitive configuration value handling
- Test configuration caching and performance optimization
- Implement integration tests for configuration change events
- Validate configuration publishing and environment variable integration

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Ensures configuration system reliability and integrity
- Validates feature toggle functionality and graceful degradation
- Confirms security measures for sensitive configuration data
- Provides confidence in runtime configuration update capabilities

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: No configuration system tests exist - complete test implementation needed
- Desired: Comprehensive test coverage (95%+) for all configuration functionality

**Dependencies:**
- Configuration management system implementation (ticket 1013)
- Caching system for configuration performance testing
- Event system for configuration change notification testing
