# Score Calculator and Threshold Management Implementation

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/2017-score-calculator-threshold-management  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Implement ScoreCalculator and threshold management system

## Description
Create the ScoreCalculator service that aggregates analyzer results into final spam scores and implements threshold management for spam detection decisions. This component provides the final scoring logic for the hybrid spam detection system.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Implement ScoreCalculator service with weighted score aggregation
- Create threshold management system with configurable thresholds
- Implement form-type specific scoring adjustments
- Add confidence metric calculation and uncertainty handling
- Create score normalization and calibration logic
- Implement threshold adaptation based on accuracy metrics
- Add comprehensive score logging and analytics
- Create score explanation and debugging capabilities

**Dependencies:**
- Tickets 2013-2016 (All Pattern Analyzers) - Required for score aggregation
- Ticket 2012 (Core SpamDetectionService) - For integration

**Expected outcomes:**
- Production-ready ScoreCalculator with accurate score aggregation
- Configurable threshold management with form-type support
- Score explanation capabilities for debugging and transparency
- Adaptive threshold adjustment based on performance metrics

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ScoreCalculator service created with weighted aggregation algorithms
- [ ] Threshold management system implemented with configuration support
- [ ] Form-type specific scoring adjustments implemented
- [ ] Confidence metric calculation implemented
- [ ] Score normalization and calibration implemented
