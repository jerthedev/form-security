# Multi-Level Caching System Specification

**Spec ID**: SPEC-003-multi-level-caching-system  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Epic**: EPIC-001 - JTD-FormSecurity Foundation Infrastructure

## Title
Multi-Level Caching System - Database, memory, and API response caching with TTL management

## Feature Overview
This specification defines a comprehensive multi-level caching system for the JTD-FormSecurity package that optimizes performance and reduces external API costs. The caching system implements three distinct layers: database caching for long-term storage, memory caching (Redis/Memcached) for frequently accessed data, and request-level caching to avoid duplicate API calls within a single request.

The system provides intelligent cache management with configurable TTL values, automatic cache invalidation, and graceful degradation when external services are unavailable. This architecture ensures optimal performance while maintaining data freshness and reducing operational costs.

Key components include:
- Multi-tier caching architecture (Database → Memory → Request)
- Configurable TTL management for different data types
- Intelligent cache invalidation and refresh strategies
- Performance optimization for high-volume form processing
- Cost reduction for external API usage

## Purpose & Rationale
### Business Justification
- **Cost Reduction**: Minimizes external API calls to services like AbuseIPDB and AI providers
- **Performance Improvement**: Reduces response times by serving cached data instead of making API calls
- **Reliability Enhancement**: Provides fallback data when external services are unavailable
- **Scalability Support**: Enables handling higher volumes without proportional cost increases

### Technical Justification
- **Response Time Optimization**: Multi-level caching reduces average response times from seconds to milliseconds
- **API Rate Limit Management**: Prevents hitting external service rate limits through intelligent caching
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces database load and external network traffic
- **Fault Tolerance**: Provides graceful degradation when external services fail

## Technical Architecture

### System Components
- **Cache Manager**: Central service for coordinating multi-level cache operations
- **Database Cache Layer**: Long-term storage using database tables with TTL management
- **Memory Cache Layer**: High-speed caching using Redis/Memcached
- **Request Cache Layer**: Single-request caching to prevent duplicate operations
- **Cache Invalidation Engine**: Intelligent cache invalidation and refresh coordination
- **Cache Statistics Service**: Monitoring and analytics for cache performance

### Data Architecture
#### Cache Layer Structure
```php
// Cache hierarchy and data flow
Level 1: Request Cache (Array/Collection)
├── Lifetime: Single request
├── Purpose: Prevent duplicate API calls within request
└── Storage: PHP memory arrays

Level 2: Memory Cache (Redis/Memcached)
├── Lifetime: Configurable TTL (5 minutes - 24 hours)
├── Purpose: High-speed access to frequently used data
└── Storage: External memory cache service

Level 3: Database Cache (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
├── Lifetime: Long-term storage with TTL management
├── Purpose: Persistent cache with complex querying
└── Storage: Dedicated cache tables with indexes
```

#### Cache Key Strategy
```php
// Cache key naming convention
'form_security:{type}:{identifier}:{version}'

Examples:
- 'form_security:ip_reputation:192.168.1.1:v1'
- 'form_security:geolocation:192.168.1.1:v1'
- 'form_security:ai_analysis:content_hash:v1'
- 'form_security:spam_patterns:all:v2'
```

### API Specifications

#### Cache Manager Interface
```php
interface CacheManagerInterface
{
    // Multi-level cache operations
    public function get(string $key, callable $callback = null, int $ttl = null): mixed;
    public function put(string $key, mixed $value, int $ttl = null): bool;
    public function forget(string $key): bool;
    public function flush(string $pattern = null): bool;
    
    // Cache layer management
    public function getFromLevel(string $key, int $level): mixed;
    public function putToLevel(string $key, mixed $value, int $level, int $ttl = null): bool;
    public function invalidateLevel(int $level): bool;
    
    // Cache statistics
    public function getStats(): array;
    public function getHitRatio(): float;
    public function getCacheSize(): int;
}

// Cache service facade methods
FormSecurity::cache()->remember(string $key, callable $callback, int $ttl = null): mixed;
FormSecurity::cache()->forget(string $key): bool;
FormSecurity::cache()->flush(string $pattern = null): bool;
FormSecurity::cache()->stats(): array;
```
