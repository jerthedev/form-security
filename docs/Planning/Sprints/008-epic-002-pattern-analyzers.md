# Epic-002 Pattern Analyzers Implementation

**Sprint ID**: 008-epic-002-pattern-analyzers  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Sprint Duration**: 2025-02-17 - 2025-03-10  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Total Points**: 44

## Sprint Goal
Implement all four specialized pattern analyzers (Email, Name, Content, Behavioral) that form the core intelligence of the hybrid spam detection algorithm.

## Sprint Overview
This sprint focuses on implementing the pattern analysis components that provide the specialized intelligence for spam detection. The primary deliverables include:

- **EmailPatternAnalyzer**: Disposable email detection, domain reputation analysis, and email validation
- **NamePatternAnalyzer**: Fake name detection, random character analysis, and cultural name patterns
- **ContentPatternAnalyzer**: Spam keyword detection, URL analysis, and Bayesian filtering integration
- **BehavioralPatternAnalyzer**: Submission behavior analysis, bot detection, and velocity monitoring

Each analyzer contributes to the hybrid detection algorithm with weighted scoring (Bayesian 40%, Regex 30%, Behavioral 20%, AI 10%). This sprint establishes the specialized intelligence components that differentiate sophisticated spam from legitimate submissions.

3. Determine the next logical task based on:
   - Task dependencies and prerequisites
   - Sprint phase progression (Email → Name → Content → Behavioral complexity order)
   - Current sprint progress and priorities
4. BEFORE starting work:
   - Update the task status to [/] in the Sprint Tasks table in the Sprint file
   - Use add_tasks tool to create a detailed breakdown of the implementation work
   - Use update_tasks tool to track progress as you work
5. Once you identify the next task:
   - Open the specific ticket file listed in the File Path column
   - Read the AI Prompt section in that ticket file
   - Begin working on that task following the ticket's instructions

SPRINT CONTEXT:
- Sprint Goal: Implement all four specialized pattern analyzers (Email, Name, Content, Behavioral) that form the core intelligence of the hybrid spam detection algorithm

## Notes
This sprint implements the core intelligence of the spam detection system through specialized analyzers. Each analyzer focuses on different aspects of spam detection:

- **Email Analyzer**: Focuses on disposable emails and domain reputation
- **Name Analyzer**: Detects fake names and suspicious character patterns  
- **Content Analyzer**: Most complex analyzer with keyword detection and Bayesian filtering
- **Behavioral Analyzer**: Analyzes submission patterns and bot behavior

**Performance Considerations:**
- Each analyzer has specific performance targets based on complexity
- Caching integration is critical for domain reputation and pattern data
- Memory optimization important for content analysis with large text processing
