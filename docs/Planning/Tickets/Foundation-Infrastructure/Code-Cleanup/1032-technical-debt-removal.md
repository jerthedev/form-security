# Technical Debt Removal

**Ticket ID**: Code-Cleanup/1032-technical-debt-removal  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Technical Debt Removal - Address technical debt and improve architectural consistency

## Description
Identify and address technical debt accumulated during the implementation phase, improve architectural consistency, and refactor any suboptimal implementations. This ticket focuses on cleaning up temporary solutions, improving design patterns, and ensuring the foundation infrastructure follows best practices consistently.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Identify and catalog technical debt from implementation phase
- Refactor temporary or suboptimal implementations
- Improve architectural consistency across all components
- Consolidate duplicate code and improve code reuse
- Optimize service interfaces and dependency injection patterns
- Improve error handling and exception management consistency
- Refactor configuration management for better maintainability
- Address any TODO comments and temporary workarounds

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Prevents technical debt from accumulating and becoming harder to address
- Improves long-term maintainability and extensibility
- Ensures consistent architectural patterns across the codebase
- Reduces complexity and improves code quality

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: Foundation infrastructure implemented with some technical debt from rapid development
- Desired: Clean, consistent architecture with minimal technical debt and optimal design patterns

**Dependencies:**
- All Implementation phase tickets completed (1010-1015)
- All Test Implementation phase tickets completed (1020-1025)
- Code quality analysis and technical debt identification
