# Detailed Service Integration Requirements

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/5005-detailed-service-integration-requirements  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Break Down Detailed Requirements for Each External Service Integration

## Description
Conduct detailed analysis and requirement breakdown for each external service integration in EPIC-005, including IP reputation checking, geolocation analysis, AI-powered spam detection, and temporary email detection. This analysis will define specific functional requirements, data flows, performance targets, and integration specifications for each service.

This analysis will break down:
- **IP Reputation Service**: AbuseIPDB integration with caching, rate limiting, and confidence scoring
- **Geolocation Service**: MaxMind GeoLite2 database integration with update management
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: xAI/OpenAI integration for content analysis with fallback mechanisms
- **Temporary Email Detection**: Disposable email service integration with local database caching
- **Service Health Monitoring**: Health check endpoints and status tracking for all services
- **Data Flow Requirements**: Input/output specifications and data transformation needs
- **Performance Requirements**: Response time targets, caching strategies, and optimization needs
- **Security Requirements**: API key management, data encryption, and privacy considerations
- **Configuration Requirements**: Settings, thresholds, and customization options
- **Error Handling Requirements**: Fallback mechanisms, retry logic, and graceful degradation

Each service integration will be analyzed for implementation complexity, dependencies, and integration patterns with the core spam detection engine.

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel package development expert specializing in external service integration. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/External-Services-Integration/Research-Audit/5005-detailed-service-integration-requirements.md

CONTEXT:
- Package: JTD-FormSecurity - Laravel form security and spam prevention
- Epic: EPIC-005 External Services Integration
- Focus: Break down detailed requirements for each service integration

SERVICE INTEGRATION AREAS:
1. IP Reputation Service (AbuseIPDB) - malicious IP detection and blocking
2. Geolocation Service (MaxMind GeoLite2) - geographic analysis and risk assessment
3. AI-Powered Analysis (xAI/OpenAI) - sophisticated spam content detection
4. Temporary Email Detection - disposable email address identification
5. Service Health Monitoring - status tracking and availability monitoring

REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS FOR EACH SERVICE:
1. Functional requirements and capabilities
2. Data flow specifications and transformations
3. Performance targets and optimization needs
4. Security requirements and data protection
5. Configuration options and customization
6. Error handling and fallback mechanisms
7. Integration patterns with core spam detection
8. Database schema and caching requirements
9. API rate limiting and cost optimization
10. Testing and validation requirements

DELIVERABLES:
1. Detailed functional specifications for each service
2. Data flow diagrams and API integration patterns
3. Performance and security requirement documentation
4. Configuration and customization specifications
5. Error handling and fallback strategy definitions
6. Integration point documentation with core detection engine
7. Database schema and caching strategy for each service
8. Implementation complexity assessment and dependency mapping

Provide comprehensive requirements that will enable precise implementation planning and ticket generation for each service integration.
```

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: Break down detailed requirements for each external service integration
- Implementation: Implement individual service integrations based on detailed requirements
- Test Implementation: Test each service integration thoroughly with various scenarios
- Code Cleanup: Optimize service implementations and refine integration patterns

## Notes
This detailed requirements analysis is essential for EPIC-005 implementation success:
- **Service-Specific Requirements**: Each service has unique integration patterns and needs
- **Performance Targets**: Sub-500ms for IP reputation, sub-100ms total integration impact
- **Cost Optimization**: Aggressive caching strategies to minimize API costs
- **Reliability**: Fallback mechanisms and graceful degradation for each service
- **Security**: Secure handling of API keys, user data, and service responses

The analysis should build on findings from previous tickets (5001-5004) and provide the detailed specifications needed to generate precise Implementation phase tickets for each service integration.
