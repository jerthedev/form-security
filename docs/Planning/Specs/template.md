3. Business Logic (Services, Events, Jobs)
4. User Interface (Components, Views, Interactions)
5. Integration (Internal/External System Connections)
6. Security & Performance (Optimization, Protection, Monitoring)

Save each ticket to: docs/Planning/Tickets/[Feature-Name]/Implementation/[ticket-number]-[short-description].md

After creating all Implementation tickets, provide a summary of:
