# Implementation Planning and Ticket Generation

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/5006-implementation-planning-ticket-generation  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Create Implementation Roadmap and Generate Phase Tickets for External Services Integration

## Description
Synthesize findings from all Research/Audit tickets (5001-5005) to create a comprehensive implementation roadmap for EPIC-005 External Services Integration. Generate detailed Implementation, Test Implementation, and Code Cleanup phase tickets based on research findings, architecture designs, and detailed requirements analysis.

This planning will include:
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Sequenced development plan with dependencies and milestones
- **Ticket Generation**: Create Implementation phase tickets (5010-5019) for development work
- **Test Planning**: Generate Test Implementation tickets (5020-5029) for comprehensive testing
- **Cleanup Planning**: Create Code Cleanup tickets (5030-5039) for optimization and refinement
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify critical path dependencies and parallel development opportunities
- **Risk Mitigation**: Plan implementation strategies for identified risks and challenges
- **Performance Targets**: Define measurable success criteria and performance benchmarks
- **Integration Strategy**: Plan integration with existing package components and core detection engine
- **Configuration Management**: Plan configuration system updates and API key management
- **Documentation Planning**: Identify documentation needs and update requirements

The roadmap will ensure systematic, efficient implementation of all external service integrations while maintaining package quality, performance, and reliability standards.

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: Synthesize research findings and create implementation roadmap
- Implementation: Execute development work based on generated tickets (5010-5019)
- Test Implementation: Execute comprehensive testing based on generated tickets (5020-5029)
- Code Cleanup: Execute optimization and refinement based on generated tickets (5030-5039)

## Notes
This planning ticket is the culmination of the Research/Audit phase and must:
- **Synthesize Findings**: Integrate all research and design work into actionable plans
- **Generate Quality Tickets**: Create detailed, actionable tickets for each implementation area
- **Optimize Sequence**: Plan development order for maximum efficiency and minimal risk
- **Ensure Completeness**: Cover all Epic requirements and success criteria
- **Plan for Quality**: Include comprehensive testing and optimization phases

The generated tickets will serve as the blueprint for EPIC-005 implementation and must be detailed enough to enable efficient, high-quality development work.
