## Title
Global Form Protection Middleware - Automatic protection for all forms without individual configuration

## Feature Overview
This specification defines a comprehensive global form protection middleware system that automatically protects all forms in a Laravel application without requiring individual form modifications. The system provides intelligent form detection, automatic spam analysis, configurable exclusions, and multiple response handling strategies.

The middleware system operates at the HTTP request level, intercepting form submissions before they reach controllers. It includes automatic form type detection, user and IP whitelisting, rate limiting integration, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities. The system is designed to be transparent to existing applications while providing robust spam protection.

Key capabilities include:
- Automatic form submission detection and analysis
- Intelligent form type detection (registration, contact, comment, generic)
- Configurable route, user, and IP exclusions
- Multiple response strategies (block, flag, allow)
- Rate limiting and honeypot integration
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Development mode support with testing utilities

## Purpose & Rationale
### Business Justification
- **Zero Configuration**: Provides immediate spam protection without code changes
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Protects all forms automatically, preventing gaps in protection
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduces manual configuration and maintenance overhead
- **Rapid Deployment**: Enables quick spam protection deployment across entire applications

### Technical Justification
- **Centralized Protection**: Single point of control for all form security policies
- **Performance Optimization**: Early detection prevents unnecessary processing of spam submissions
- **Flexibility**: Extensive configuration options allow fine-tuning for specific applications
- **Maintainability**: Centralized middleware is easier to maintain than distributed validation rules
