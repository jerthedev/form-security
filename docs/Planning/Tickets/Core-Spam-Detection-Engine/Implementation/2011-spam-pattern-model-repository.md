# Spam Pattern Model and Repository Implementation

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/2011-spam-pattern-model-repository  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Complete âœ… - All acceptance criteria met and tests passing

## Title
Implement SpamPattern Eloquent model and repository with caching integration

## Description
Create the SpamPattern Eloquent model and SpamPatternRepository to provide data access layer for spam pattern management. This includes pattern CRUD operations, caching integration, and performance-optimized queries for pattern matching operations.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Implement SpamPattern Eloquent model with proper relationships and casting
- Create SpamPatternRepository with pattern management methods
- Integrate Epic-001 caching system for pattern data optimization
- Implement pattern validation and sanitization logic
- Add pattern effectiveness tracking and analytics methods
- Create pattern import/export functionality for pattern management
- Implement pattern versioning and rollback capabilities

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Provides object-oriented interface for spam pattern data access
- Enables efficient pattern caching and retrieval optimization
- Required foundation for all pattern analyzer implementations
- Supports pattern management and maintenance workflows

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: Database schema exists but no data access layer
- Desired: Complete pattern data access with caching and performance optimization

**Dependencies:**
- Ticket 2010 (Database Schema) - spam_patterns table must exist
- Epic-001 CacheService - for pattern caching integration

**Expected outcomes:**
- Production-ready SpamPattern model with full functionality
- Repository pattern implementation with caching optimization
- Pattern management methods supporting high-performance queries
- Pattern effectiveness tracking and analytics capabilities
