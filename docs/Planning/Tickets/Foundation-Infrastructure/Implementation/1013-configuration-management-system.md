# Configuration Management System

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/1013-configuration-management-system  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Configuration Management System - Implement hierarchical configuration with validation and runtime updates

## Description
Implement a comprehensive configuration management system that supports hierarchical configuration loading, feature toggles with graceful degradation, runtime configuration updates, and comprehensive validation. The system will leverage Laravel 12's configuration features and PHP 8.2+ enums for type safety.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Create ConfigurationManager service with hierarchical configuration loading
- Implement feature toggle system with graceful degradation capabilities
- Build configuration validation engine with comprehensive business rules
- Add runtime configuration updates without application restart
- Create configuration caching system for performance optimization
- Implement secure handling of sensitive configuration values
- Add configuration change event system for cache invalidation
- Create configuration publishing and management CLI commands

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Enables modular package architecture with independent feature control
- Provides flexible configuration management for different deployment environments
- Ensures configuration integrity through comprehensive validation
- Supports dynamic configuration changes for operational flexibility

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: No configuration system exists - complete configuration management implementation needed
- Desired: Fully functional hierarchical configuration system with validation and runtime updates

**Dependencies:**
- Service provider implementation for configuration service registration
- Caching system for configuration performance optimization
- Event system for configuration change notifications
