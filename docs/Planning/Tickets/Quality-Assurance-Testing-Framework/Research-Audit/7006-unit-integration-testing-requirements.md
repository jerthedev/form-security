# Unit & Integration Testing Requirements - Quality Assurance & Testing Framework

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/7006-unit-integration-testing-requirements  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Define comprehensive unit and integration testing requirements for all package components

## Description
Define detailed requirements for unit and integration testing that will achieve 100% code coverage across all JTD-FormSecurity package components. This analysis will break down testing requirements for every class, method, and component interaction to ensure comprehensive validation.

This requirements analysis will address:
- Unit testing requirements for all classes, methods, and functions
- Integration testing for component interactions and workflows
- Test coverage requirements and measurement strategies
- Test data requirements and factory design specifications
- Mock service requirements for external dependencies
- Database testing requirements and transaction strategies
- Error handling and edge case testing requirements
- Backward compatibility and upgrade testing requirements

The requirements will serve as the foundation for implementing comprehensive unit and integration tests that validate all package functionality.

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel package development expert specializing in comprehensive unit and integration testing. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Quality-Assurance-Testing-Framework/Research-Audit/7006-unit-integration-testing-requirements.md

ANALYSIS SCOPE:
- Complete JTD-FormSecurity package codebase
- All classes, methods, and functions requiring unit tests
- All component interactions requiring integration tests
- Database models, migrations, and relationships
- External service integrations and API calls
- Error handling and edge case scenarios

REQUIREMENTS TO DEFINE:
1. **Unit Testing**: Every class, method, and function testing requirements
2. **Integration Testing**: Component interaction and workflow testing
3. **Test Coverage**: Measurement strategies and 100% coverage approach
4. **Test Data**: Factory patterns and database seeding requirements
5. **Mock Services**: External dependency isolation strategies
6. **Database Testing**: Model, migration, and relationship testing
7. **Error Handling**: Exception and edge case testing requirements
8. **Performance**: Critical algorithm and bottleneck testing

DELIVERABLES:
- Comprehensive unit testing requirements specification
- Integration testing requirements and scenarios
- Test coverage strategy and measurement plan
- Test data management and factory specifications
- Mock service architecture requirements
- Database testing strategy and requirements

Please analyze the entire package and define comprehensive testing requirements that will achieve 100% coverage and validate all functionality.
```

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: Define comprehensive unit and integration testing requirements based on complete package analysis to ensure 100% coverage and thorough validation

## Notes
This requirements definition is crucial for achieving the Epic's 100% coverage goal. The analysis must be:
- Comprehensive and cover every component
- Specific enough to guide implementation
- Organized to support efficient test development
- Aligned with the testing architecture design

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] 7001-current-state-analysis - Understanding current codebase structure
- [ ] 7004-testing-architecture-design - Testing organization and structure
- [ ] Complete access to all package source code and components
- [ ] Understanding of all other Epic requirements for comprehensive coverage
