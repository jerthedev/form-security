## AI Prompts

### 1. Next Task Determination Prompt
```
You are a Laravel package development expert working on the JTD-FormSecurity package.

TASK: Determine the next task to work on in the current sprint.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the Sprint file at: docs/Planning/Sprints/005-code-cleanup-optimization.md
2. Analyze the Sprint Tasks table to identify:
   - Tasks marked as complete [x]
   - Tasks currently in progress [/]
   - Tasks not yet started [ ]
3. Determine the next logical task based on:
   - Task dependencies and prerequisites (Performance → Quality → Debt Removal)
   - Code cleanup phase progression
   - Current sprint progress and priorities
4. BEFORE starting work:
   - Update the task status to [/] in the Sprint Tasks table in the Sprint file
   - Use add_tasks tool to create a detailed breakdown of the cleanup work
   - Use update_tasks tool to track progress as you work
5. Once you identify the next task:
   - Open the specific ticket file listed in the File Path column
   - Read the AI Prompt section in that ticket file
   - Begin working on that task following the ticket's instructions

SPRINT CONTEXT:
- Sprint Goal: Optimize and refine the JTD-FormSecurity foundation infrastructure through comprehensive performance optimization, code quality improvements, and technical debt removal
- Current Sprint: 005-code-cleanup-optimization

### 2. Task Completion Validation Prompt
```
You are a Laravel package development expert responsible for validating task completion in the JTD-FormSecurity package.

TASK: Validate that the most recently worked on task has been completed successfully.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the Sprint file at: docs/Planning/Sprints/005-code-cleanup-optimization.md
2. Identify the last task that was marked as in progress [/] or recently completed
