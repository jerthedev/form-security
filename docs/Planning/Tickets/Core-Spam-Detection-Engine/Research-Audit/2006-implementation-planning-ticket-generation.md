- Establish clear dependencies between tickets
- Include specific acceptance criteria and deliverables
- Reference research findings from previous tickets
- Include comprehensive AI prompts for implementation guidance

IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCING:
- Consider dependencies between components
- Prioritize core services before specialized analyzers
- Ensure database and configuration setup before service implementation
- Plan testing tickets to validate each implementation ticket
- Schedule cleanup tickets after implementation and testing completion

Create comprehensive implementation plan with:
- Detailed ticket specifications for each phase
- Dependency mapping and sequencing recommendations
- Resource allocation and effort estimates
- Risk mitigation strategies for complex implementations
