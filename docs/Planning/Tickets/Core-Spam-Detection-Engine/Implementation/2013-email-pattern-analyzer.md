# Email Pattern Analyzer Implementation

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/2013-email-pattern-analyzer  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Implement EmailPatternAnalyzer for email address spam detection

## Description
Create the EmailPatternAnalyzer component that specializes in detecting spam patterns in email addresses including disposable emails, suspicious domains, suspicious patterns, and domain reputation analysis. This analyzer contributes to the hybrid spam detection system with specialized email-focused algorithms.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Implement EmailPatternAnalyzer class with email-specific detection algorithms
- Create disposable email domain detection with regularly updated domain lists
- Implement suspicious email pattern matching (character patterns, domain patterns)
- Add domain reputation analysis with configurable whitelist/blacklist
- Implement email validation and normalization logic
- Create email pattern scoring with confidence metrics
- Add email pattern learning and adaptation capabilities
- Integrate with pattern caching system for performance optimization

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Email addresses are primary spam vector requiring specialized analysis
- Disposable email detection prevents spam registrations and submissions
- Domain reputation analysis improves detection accuracy
- Required component for hybrid spam detection algorithm

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: Core SpamDetectionService framework available
- Desired: Specialized email analyzer with high accuracy and performance

**Dependencies:**
- Ticket 2012 (Core SpamDetectionService) - Service framework must exist
- Ticket 2011 (SpamPattern Model) - For pattern data access
- Epic-001 CacheService - For domain reputation and pattern caching

**Expected outcomes:**
- Production-ready EmailPatternAnalyzer with high detection accuracy
- Disposable email domain detection with 99%+ accuracy
- Domain reputation system with configurable policies
- Performance-optimized email analysis with caching
