# Current State Analysis - Quality Assurance & Testing Framework

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/7001-current-state-analysis  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Analyze current testing infrastructure and quality assurance state of JTD-FormSecurity package

## Description
Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the existing JTD-FormSecurity codebase to understand the current state of testing infrastructure, quality assurance processes, and identify gaps that need to be addressed to achieve the Epic's goals of 100% test coverage and comprehensive quality assurance.

This analysis will:
- Evaluate existing testing infrastructure and test files
- Assess current code quality tools and configurations
- Analyze package structure for testability
- Identify current dependencies and their testing implications
- Document gaps between current state and Epic requirements
- Provide baseline metrics for improvement tracking
- Establish foundation for subsequent research and implementation tickets

The findings will directly inform the architecture design and implementation planning for the comprehensive testing framework.
