## Title
Universal Spam Validation Rule - Generic Laravel validation rule that works with any form type

## Feature Overview
This specification defines a universal Laravel validation rule that provides comprehensive spam protection for any form type. The SpamValidationRule is designed to be flexible, configurable, and easily integrated into existing Laravel applications without requiring significant code changes. It serves as the primary interface between form validation and the spam detection engine.

The rule supports multiple form types (user registration, contact, comment, newsletter, generic), configurable analysis parameters, conditional AI integration, and comprehensive error handling. It implements Laravel's ValidationRule and DataAwareRule interfaces to provide seamless integration with Laravel's validation system.

Key capabilities include:
- Universal form compatibility with type-specific optimizations
- Configurable spam analysis parameters and thresholds
- Conditional AI analysis for borderline cases
- Comprehensive error messaging with form-specific customization
- Event system integration for monitoring and analytics
- Performance optimization with early exit strategies

## Purpose & Rationale
### Business Justification
- **Ease of Integration**: Provides simple, one-line integration for any Laravel form
- **Flexibility**: Supports various form types with specialized analysis for each
- **User Experience**: Maintains smooth user experience while blocking spam effectively
- **Cost Control**: Conditional AI analysis reduces external API costs

### Technical Justification
- **Laravel Integration**: Follows Laravel validation conventions for seamless integration
- **Performance**: Optimized validation logic with early exit and caching strategies
- **Extensibility**: Configurable parameters allow customization without code changes
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation between validation logic and spam detection engine

## Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **FR-001**: Implement universal SpamValidationRule class supporting all form types
- [ ] **FR-002**: Create configurable constructor with form type, required fields, and AI settings
- [ ] **FR-003**: Implement form-specific analysis logic (user registration, contact, comment, newsletter, generic)
- [ ] **FR-004**: Provide configurable spam thresholds with form-specific defaults
- [ ] **FR-005**: Implement conditional AI analysis based on score ranges and form types
- [ ] **FR-006**: Create comprehensive error messaging system with customizable messages
- [ ] **FR-007**: Implement event system integration for spam detection and blocking events
- [ ] **FR-008**: Provide field mapping system for different form field names

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] **NFR-001**: Validation rule execution must complete within 100ms for 95% of requests
- [ ] **NFR-002**: Support concurrent validation of up to 500 forms per minute
- [ ] **NFR-003**: Memory usage must remain under 50MB during validation operations
- [ ] **NFR-004**: Integration must require minimal code changes to existing forms
- [ ] **NFR-005**: Error handling must gracefully degrade without blocking legitimate users

### Business Rules
- [ ] **BR-001**: Validation only triggers when all required fields are present in form data
- [ ] **BR-002**: Spam scores above configured thresholds result in validation failure
- [ ] **BR-003**: AI analysis only triggers for borderline scores within configured ranges
- [ ] **BR-004**: Blocked submissions must be logged with comprehensive metadata
- [ ] **BR-005**: Validation errors must provide user-friendly messages without revealing detection methods

{
    public function __construct(
        string $formType = 'generic',
        array $requiredFields = ['name', 'email'],

    public function validate(string $attribute, mixed $value, Closure $fail): void;
}
```

#### Configuration Structure
```php
// Form-specific configuration
[
    'form_types' => [
        'user_registration' => [
            'required_fields' => ['name', 'email'],
            'threshold_key' => 'thresholds.user_registration.block',
            'ai_enabled' => false,
            'error_message_key' => 'error_messages.user_registration',
        ],
        'contact' => [
            'required_fields' => ['name', 'email', 'message'],
            'threshold_key' => 'thresholds.contact.block',
            'ai_enabled' => true,
            'error_message_key' => 'error_messages.contact',
        ],
    ],
    'field_mapping' => [
        'contact' => [
            'name' => ['name', 'full_name', 'contact_name'],
            'email' => ['email', 'email_address', 'contact_email'],
            'message' => ['message', 'content', 'inquiry', 'body'],
        ],
    ],
]
```

### API Specifications

#### Core Validation Interface
```php
// Basic usage
new SpamValidationRule()

// Form-specific usage
new SpamValidationRule(
    formType: 'contact',
    requiredFields: ['name', 'email', 'message'],
    enableAi: true
)

// Advanced configuration
new SpamValidationRule(
    formType: 'user_registration',
    requiredFields: ['name', 'email'],
    enableAi: false,
    customThresholdKey: 'custom.registration.threshold',
    customConfig: [
        'check_ip_reputation' => true,
        'block_temporary_emails' => true,
    ]
)
```

#### Integration Examples
```php
// Controller validation
$validator = Validator::make($request->all(), [
    'message' => [
        'required',
        'string',
        'max:2000',
        new SpamValidationRule('contact', ['name', 'email', 'message'])
    ]
]);

// Form Request integration
class ContactFormRequest extends FormRequest
{
    public function rules(): array
    {
        return [
            'name' => 'required|string|max:50',
            'email' => 'required|email',
            'message' => [
                'required',
                'string',
                'max:2000',
                new SpamValidationRule('contact', ['name', 'email', 'message'])
            ]
        ];
    }
}

// Livewire integration
class ContactForm extends Component
{
    protected function rules()
    {
        return [
            'message' => [
                'required',
                'string',
                'max:2000',
                new SpamValidationRule('contact', ['name', 'email', 'message'])
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

### Integration Requirements
- **Internal Integrations**: Seamless integration with spam detection service and configuration system
- **External Integrations**: Laravel validation system, event system, and caching layer
- **Event System**: Spam detection events (SpamDetected, SubmissionBlocked, HighRiskPatternDetected)
- **Queue/Job Requirements**: Background logging and analytics processing for blocked submissions

## User Interface Specifications

### Error Message System
```php
// Configurable error messages by form type
'error_messages' => [
    'user_registration' => 'Registration failed spam verification. Please use different information or contact support.',
    'contact' => 'Your message was flagged as potential spam. Please revise your content and try again.',
    'comment' => 'Your comment was flagged as potential spam. Please revise your content.',
    'newsletter' => 'Subscription failed verification. Please try again or contact support.',
    'generic' => 'Your submission was flagged as potential spam. Please revise your content and try again.',
]
```

### Validation Response Format
- **Success**: Validation passes silently, form processing continues
- **Failure**: Validation fails with user-friendly error message
- **Error**: Graceful degradation with logging, validation passes to avoid blocking legitimate users

## Security Considerations
- [ ] **Input Validation**: All form data validated and sanitized before spam analysis
- [ ] **Error Message Security**: Error messages don't reveal specific detection methods or patterns
- [ ] **Data Protection**: Form data handled securely with appropriate logging and retention policies
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Validation includes rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: All blocked submissions logged with comprehensive metadata for security analysis

## Performance Requirements
- [ ] **Response Time**: Validation completes within 100ms for 95% of requests
- [ ] **Throughput**: Support 500+ concurrent form validations per minute
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Validation operations use less than 50MB memory
- [ ] **Cache Utilization**: Leverage caching system for repeated analysis patterns
- [ ] **Early Exit**: Optimization strategies to exit early when thresholds are exceeded
