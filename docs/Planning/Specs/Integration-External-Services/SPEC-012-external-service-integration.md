## Title
External Service Integration Framework - Unified framework for integrating AbuseIPDB, GeoLite2, and AI services

## Feature Overview
This specification defines a comprehensive framework for integrating external services that enhance the spam detection capabilities of the JTD-FormSecurity package. The framework provides a unified interface for managing multiple external service providers including AbuseIPDB for IP reputation, MaxMind GeoLite2 for geolocation data, and AI services (xAI/OpenAI) for intelligent content analysis.

The framework emphasizes reliability, performance, and cost management through intelligent caching, rate limiting, graceful degradation, and comprehensive error handling. It provides a plugin-based architecture that allows easy addition of new service providers while maintaining consistent interfaces and behavior patterns.

Key capabilities include:
- Unified service provider interface with consistent API patterns
- Intelligent rate limiting and cost management across all services
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation strategies
- Multi-level caching for performance optimization and cost reduction
- Service health monitoring and automatic failover capabilities
- Configuration management with environment-specific settings
- Extensible plugin architecture for custom service integrations

## Purpose & Rationale
### Business Justification
- **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent caching and rate limiting minimize external API costs
- **Reliability**: Graceful degradation ensures system functionality when external services fail
- **Scalability**: Framework supports high-volume operations with efficient resource management
- **Flexibility**: Plugin architecture allows easy integration of new service providers

### Technical Justification
- **Consistency**: Unified interface provides consistent behavior across all external services
- **Performance**: Multi-level caching and intelligent request management optimize response times
- **Maintainability**: Centralized service management simplifies maintenance and updates
- **Extensibility**: Plugin-based architecture enables easy addition of new service providers
