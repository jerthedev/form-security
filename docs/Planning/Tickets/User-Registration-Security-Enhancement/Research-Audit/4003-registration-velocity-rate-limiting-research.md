**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Research Registration Velocity Detection Algorithms and Rate Limiting Implementation Strategies

## Description
Conduct comprehensive research on algorithms, patterns, and implementation strategies for detecting rapid-fire registration attempts and implementing effective rate limiting for user registration processes. This research will inform the design of velocity checking systems that can detect mass registration attacks while minimizing false positives for legitimate users.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Research velocity detection algorithms and mathematical models
- Investigate time window analysis strategies and configuration approaches
- Analyze rate limiting implementation patterns and best practices
- Study IP-based vs user-based velocity tracking approaches
- Research integration patterns with existing Laravel rate limiting systems
- Investigate performance optimization techniques for velocity calculations
- Analyze false positive reduction strategies for legitimate bulk registrations

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Registration velocity checking is a critical defense against mass registration attacks
- Need sophisticated algorithms that balance security with user experience
- Must integrate seamlessly with Laravel's existing rate limiting infrastructure
- Performance optimization is crucial for high-volume registration scenarios
- False positive reduction is essential to avoid blocking legitimate users

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: No velocity checking system for registration attempts
- Desired: Sophisticated velocity detection with configurable thresholds and time windows

**Dependencies:**
- Laravel 12.x rate limiting system documentation
- Mathematical models for velocity detection
- Performance benchmarking requirements
- Integration with existing spam detection services

**Expected outcomes:**
- Comprehensive research report on velocity detection algorithms
- Rate limiting implementation strategy recommendations
- Performance optimization guidelines for velocity calculations
- Integration approach with Laravel rate limiting systems
- Configuration strategy for time windows and thresholds
