# Quality Assurance Workflow Design - Quality Assurance & Testing Framework

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/7005-quality-assurance-workflow-design  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Design comprehensive quality assurance workflows and automated quality enforcement processes

## Description
Design comprehensive quality assurance workflows that integrate seamlessly with development processes to ensure consistent code quality, automated validation, and reliable package releases. These workflows will enforce quality standards throughout the development lifecycle.

This design will address:
- Pre-commit hooks and local quality validation
- Automated CI/CD pipeline quality gates
- Code review processes and quality checklists
- Release quality validation and automation
- Performance benchmarking and regression detection
- Security testing integration and vulnerability management
- Documentation testing and validation workflows
- Community contribution quality processes

The workflows will ensure that quality is maintained consistently across all development activities and that the package meets professional standards for public distribution.
