# Pattern Cache Integration and Optimization

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/2018-pattern-cache-integration-optimization  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Implement pattern cache integration and performance optimization

## Description
Create comprehensive caching integration for spam detection patterns and results, implementing the multi-tier caching strategy designed in the architecture phase. This includes pattern caching, result caching, and cache invalidation strategies.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Implement PatternCacheService with multi-tier caching strategy
- Create result caching for spam detection outcomes
- Implement intelligent cache invalidation and warming
- Add cache performance monitoring and metrics
- Create cache configuration and management interfaces
- Implement cache fallback strategies for reliability
- Add cache analytics and optimization recommendations
- Integrate cache warming with application startup

**Dependencies:**
- Ticket 2017 (Score Calculator) - For result caching
- Epic-001 CacheService - Base caching infrastructure

**Expected outcomes:**
- Production-ready caching system with 90%+ hit ratio
- Sub-10ms cache response times for pattern retrieval
- Intelligent cache invalidation preventing stale data
- Comprehensive cache monitoring and analytics

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PatternCacheService implemented with multi-tier caching
- [ ] Result caching implemented with configurable TTL
- [ ] Cache invalidation strategies implemented
- [ ] Cache warming and preloading implemented
- [ ] Cache performance monitoring implemented
- [ ] Cache fallback strategies implemented for reliability
