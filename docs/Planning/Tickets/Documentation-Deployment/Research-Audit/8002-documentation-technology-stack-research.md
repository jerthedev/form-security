# Documentation Technology Stack Research

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/8002-documentation-technology-stack-research  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Research and evaluate documentation tools, hosting platforms, and automation technologies

## Description
Conduct comprehensive research on modern documentation technologies, tools, and platforms to identify the optimal technology stack for the JTD-FormSecurity package documentation system. This research will inform architecture decisions and ensure the chosen solutions meet performance, maintenance, and user experience requirements.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Research API documentation generation tools (phpDocumentor, Sami, etc.)
- Evaluate static site generators for documentation websites
- Investigate hosting platforms and their capabilities
- Research search solutions and performance characteristics
- Analyze automation tools for keeping documentation current
- Compare costs, maintenance requirements, and scalability

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Ensures optimal technology choices for long-term success
- Prevents costly technology changes later in development
- Identifies automation opportunities to reduce maintenance burden
- Ensures performance and accessibility requirements can be met
- Provides foundation for architecture planning decisions

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: No established documentation technology stack
- Desired: Well-researched technology recommendations with clear rationale

**Dependencies:**
- Completion of 8001-current-state-documentation-analysis
- EPIC-008 performance and functionality requirements
- Project guidelines for Laravel community standards

**Expected outcomes:**
- Technology comparison matrix with recommendations
- Cost analysis and maintenance requirements assessment
- Performance benchmarking data for key solutions
- Automation strategy recommendations

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel package development expert specializing in documentation technology research. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Documentation-Deployment/Research-Audit/8002-documentation-technology-stack-research.md, including the title, description, related documentation, files, and tests listed above.

TICKET DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
- Template: docs/Planning/Tickets/template.md
- Major Features: Epics defined in docs/Planning/Epics/
- Phases: Research/Audit, Implementation, Test Implementation, Code Cleanup
- Format: docs/Planning/Tickets/<Major Feature>/<Phase>/####-short-description.md
- Numbering: 8000s for EPIC-008 Documentation & Deployment

Based on this ticket:
1. Research modern API documentation generation tools for PHP/Laravel packages
2. Evaluate static site generators suitable for technical documentation
3. Compare hosting platforms for documentation sites with performance analysis
4. Research search solutions that meet the <1 second response requirement
5. Investigate automation tools for maintaining documentation currency
6. Analyze costs, security, and long-term viability of options
7. Create detailed comparison matrix with recommendations
8. Use Brave Search to find latest information about documentation tools and best practices

Please be thorough and consider Laravel community standards, public package requirements, performance targets, and automation capabilities.
```

## Phase Descriptions
- Research/Audit: 
  - Gather requirements
  - Search latest information about APIs and development practices including how other developers have solved similar problems using Brave Search MCP
  - Analyze existing code, plan implementation
  - Generate tickets for Implementation, Test Implementation, and Code Cleanup based on findings
- Implementation: Develop new features, update documentation
- Test Implementation: Write tests, verify functionality, performance, security
- Code Cleanup: Refactor, optimize, remove technical debt (optional, only if needed)

## Notes
This research is critical for making informed technology decisions that will impact the entire documentation system. Key considerations:
- Laravel community preferences and standards
- Public package documentation best practices
- GitHub/Packagist integration requirements
- Performance targets from EPIC-008 (3-second load times, 1-second search)
- Automation capabilities to reduce maintenance burden
- Long-term sustainability and community support

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 days)

## Dependencies
- [ ] 8001-current-state-documentation-analysis - Baseline understanding of current state
- [ ] EPIC-008 performance and functionality requirements
- [ ] Project guidelines for technology standards
