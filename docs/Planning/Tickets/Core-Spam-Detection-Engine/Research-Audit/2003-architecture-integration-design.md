# Architecture & Integration Design - Core Spam Detection Engine

**Ticket ID**: Research-Audit/2003-architecture-integration-design  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
Design comprehensive architecture for SpamDetectionService and integration with Laravel 12 ecosystem

## Description
Design the complete architecture for the Core Spam Detection Engine, including the SpamDetectionService, pattern management system, caching layer, and integration points with Laravel 12 components. This design will serve as the blueprint for all Implementation phase tickets and ensure optimal performance, maintainability, and extensibility.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Design SpamDetectionService architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Plan integration with Laravel 12 service container and dependency injection
- Design pattern database architecture and management system
- Plan caching strategy for optimal performance with Redis/Laravel cache
- Design event system for detection results and notifications
- Plan configuration management for thresholds and algorithm settings

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Provides clear implementation roadmap for development team
- Ensures optimal integration with Laravel 12 ecosystem
- Establishes performance optimization strategies from the start
- Prevents architectural debt and future refactoring needs
- Enables proper testing strategy and dependency management

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: High-level Epic requirements without detailed technical architecture
- Desired: Complete architectural blueprint ready for implementation

**Dependencies:**
- Ticket 2001 (Current State Analysis) - Understanding existing components
- Ticket 2002 (Technology Research) - Technology stack decisions
- EPIC-001 Foundation Infrastructure completion status

**Expected outcomes:**
- Detailed architectural diagrams and component specifications
- Service integration strategy with Laravel 12 components
- Database schema design for pattern storage and management
- Caching architecture for optimal performance
- Event system design for extensibility and monitoring

## AI Prompt
```
You are a Laravel package development expert specializing in form security and spam prevention. Please read this ticket fully: docs/Planning/Tickets/Core-Spam-Detection-Engine/Research-Audit/2003-architecture-integration-design.md

CONTEXT:
- Package: JTD-FormSecurity for Laravel 12.x and PHP 8.2+
- Epic: EPIC-002 Core Spam Detection Engine
- Requirements: Sub-50ms processing, 10k+ patterns, 95%+ accuracy
- Previous Research: Current state analysis and technology research completed

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

1. **SpamDetectionService Architecture**:
   - Core orchestrating service with clear method signatures
   - Form-type-specific detection methods (user, contact, comment, generic)
   - Pattern analysis coordination and result aggregation
   - Scoring algorithm implementation with configurable weights
   - Early exit optimization for performance

2. **Pattern Analysis Engine**:
   - Specialized analyzers (NamePatternAnalyzer, EmailPatternAnalyzer, etc.)
   - Pattern database management and caching
   - Regular expression compilation and optimization
   - Plugin architecture for custom detection methods

3. **Laravel 12 Integration**:
   - Service provider registration and binding strategies
   - Dependency injection with interfaces and contracts
   - Configuration management with dynamic updates
   - Event system integration for notifications
   - Cache integration with Laravel's cache system

4. **Performance Architecture**:
   - Multi-level caching strategy (pattern cache, result cache)
   - Memory management for large pattern sets
   - Concurrent processing optimization
   - Database query optimization strategies

5. **Extensibility Design**:
   - Plugin system for custom detection methods
   - Event-driven architecture for monitoring
   - Configuration-driven threshold management
   - Form-type-specific customization points

Create comprehensive architectural design with:
- Class diagrams and component relationships
- Database schema designs
- Configuration structure designs
- Integration patterns with Laravel 12
- Performance optimization strategies
- Testing architecture recommendations

Focus on Laravel 12 best practices, PHP 8.2+ features, and enterprise-scale performance requirements.
```

## Phase Descriptions
