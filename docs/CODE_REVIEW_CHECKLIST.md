## Common Issues Checklist

### ‚ùå Avoid These Common Problems

#### Code Issues
- [ ] **God Classes**: Avoid classes that do too much

- [ ] **Dead Code**: Remove commented out or unused code

#### Laravel Issues  
- [ ] **N+1 Queries**: Watch for N+1 query problems in relationships
- [ ] **Mass Assignment**: Don't forget `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties
- [ ] **Facade Overuse**: Prefer dependency injection over facades
- [ ] **Route Model Binding**: Use route model binding when appropriate
- [ ] **Validation**: Don't skip input validation

#### Testing Issues
- [ ] **Test Independence**: Tests should not depend on each other
- [ ] **Database State**: Clean up test database state properly
- [ ] **Time Dependencies**: Don't use actual time/dates in tests
- [ ] **External Dependencies**: Mock external services appropriately
- [ ] **Assertion Quality**: Use specific assertions, not just `assertTrue`

#### Security Issues
- [ ] **Input Validation**: All user inputs must be validated
- [ ] **Output Escaping**: Escape output to prevent XSS
- [ ] **SQL Injection**: Use query builder or prepared statements
- [ ] **CSRF Protection**: CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- [ ] **Authentication**: Verify authentication for protected operations
