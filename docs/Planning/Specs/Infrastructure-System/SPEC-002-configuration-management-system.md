# Configuration Management System Specification

**Spec ID**: SPEC-002-configuration-management-system  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: High  
**Related Epic**: EPIC-001 - JTD-FormSecurity Foundation Infrastructure

## Title
Configuration Management System - Modular configuration system with feature toggles and environment-specific settings

## Feature Overview
This specification defines a comprehensive, modular configuration management system for the JTD-FormSecurity package. The system provides extensive customization options for spam detection behavior, thresholds, integrations, and performance settings. The configuration architecture is designed to be **fully modular** - each protection layer can be independently enabled or disabled, allowing users to implement only the features they need while maintaining full functionality.

Key capabilities include:
- Modular feature toggles for independent protection layers
- Environment-specific configuration with .env variable support
- Dynamic runtime configuration updates
- Form-specific threshold management
- Comprehensive validation and error handling
- Configuration publishing and management commands

## Purpose & Rationale
### Business Justification
- **Flexibility**: Allows customers to start with basic protection and scale up as needed
- **Cost Control**: Enables disabling expensive features (AI analysis) while maintaining core protection
- **Customization**: Provides fine-grained control over spam detection behavior for different use cases
- **Ease of Deployment**: Environment-specific settings simplify deployment across different environments

### Technical Justification
- **Modular Architecture**: Each feature operates independently, reducing coupling and improving maintainability
- **Performance Optimization**: Allows disabling unused features to improve performance
- **Configuration Validation**: Prevents misconfigurations that could compromise security or functionality
- **Runtime Flexibility**: Supports dynamic configuration updates without application restarts

## Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **FR-001**: Implement modular feature toggle system allowing independent enable/disable of protection layers
- [ ] **FR-002**: Create comprehensive configuration file with environment variable support for all settings

- [ ] **FR-005**: Create configuration validation system to prevent invalid configurations
- [ ] **FR-006**: Implement configuration publishing commands for customization
- [ ] **FR-007**: Support multiple configuration profiles (minimal, IP-focused, AI-powered, full-stack)
- [ ] **FR-008**: Create exclusion system for routes, users, and IP addresses

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] **NFR-001**: Configuration loading must complete within 50ms during application bootstrap
- [ ] **NFR-002**: Runtime configuration updates must take effect within 100ms without application restart

### Business Rules
- [ ] **BR-001**: Block thresholds must always be higher than flag thresholds for the same form type
- [ ] **BR-002**: AI analysis cannot be enabled without a valid API key configuration
- [ ] **BR-003**: IP reputation features require valid AbuseIPDB API key when enabled
- [ ] **BR-004**: Geolocation features require valid GeoLite2 database path when enabled
- [ ] **BR-005**: Global middleware cannot be enabled without proper exclusion rules configured

## Technical Architecture

### System Components
- **Configuration Manager**: Central service for loading, validating, and managing configuration
- **Feature Toggle System**: Independent feature flags with graceful degradation
- **Threshold Manager**: Dynamic threshold management with form-specific overrides
- **Validation Engine**: Comprehensive configuration validation with detailed error reporting
- **Publishing System**: Artisan commands for configuration file publishing and management
