# CLI Commands Development

**Ticket ID**: Implementation/1015-cli-commands-development  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Not Started

## Title
CLI Commands Development - Implement comprehensive command suite with Laravel 12 console features

## Description
Implement a comprehensive suite of CLI commands that leverage Laravel 12's enhanced console features including Laravel Prompts, command isolation, and improved progress reporting. The command suite will cover installation, maintenance, diagnostics, and analytics with excellent user experience and robust error handling.

**What needs to be accomplished:**
- Create base FormSecurityCommand class with common functionality
- Implement installation commands with interactive prompts and validation
- Build maintenance commands for cleanup, optimization, and cache management
- Create diagnostic commands for health checks and system analysis
- Develop analytics commands for reporting and data export
- Implement Laravel 12 console features (prompts, isolation, progress bars)
- Add comprehensive error handling and recovery procedures
- Create command testing framework with output validation

**Why this work is necessary:**
- Provides essential package management and maintenance capabilities
- Enables excellent user experience through modern CLI patterns
- Supports system administration and operational requirements
- Facilitates package installation, configuration, and troubleshooting

**Current state vs desired state:**
- Current: No CLI commands exist - complete command suite implementation needed
- Desired: Comprehensive command suite with modern Laravel 12 console features

**Dependencies:**
- Service provider implementation for command registration
- Configuration system for command settings and validation
- Database and caching systems for command functionality
